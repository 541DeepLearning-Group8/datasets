1/24/2013,41298,3.0,"I had moved here in December 2011. The leasing rep was so unprofessional and unorganized. You could tell she was new and didn't explain anything on the lease and was pretty much with a fend for yourself attitude. She ended up being fired... along with the leasing manager. It took the office at least 5 months to correct our rent. My roommate and I received letters how we didn't pay our full amount of rent when we had already sent an e-mail explaining the situation. Maintenance has always been timely yet they never walk in with scrub booties on to protect the carpet. Yet, the renter is responsible for ensuring its clean. At least, Cox cable services have more respect and consideration when they come to install your cable. The people here at Riverside are very unorganized. Moving out with Riverside has been such a pain because of poor accounting practices and inputting inaccurate information to where you owe something when you shouldn't. You have to constantly hound the management office to correct things. I calculated my final move out costs and it shows that they owe me money after applying my deposit, yet somehow in the system it comes out to me owing money. It's ridiculous. The pros for staying here was the nice view on the eighth floor and having concrete walls and of course two full bathrooms. Our apt was 1100 square foot which is very roomy. The cons are obviously the management here. In addition, the galley way kitchen and lack of central air. Also, as with any old high rise, there will be a roach problem on occasion. because of dirty people.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

2/20/2016,42420,2.0,"I lived at VENN for ~2 years and recently made the decision to move out for safety/security reasons. When I signed my lease, I was promised onsite security after hours which was a top selling point for me. Soon after I moved in, building management changed and onsite security was ended without notice or warning. Shortly thereafter, the problems started. Stolen packages were a regular occurrence. Transients began entering the building and were discovered sleeping in our elevator, stairwells, and breaking into apartments. Meanwhile, management continued to raise the already high rents without investing in adequate security. 

On the plus side, the apartments are new, the location is very central and the neighbors are nice. However for me, these benefits were not significant enough to outweigh the major security issues.",1.0,Silver,51.0,2.0,0.0

I do have 2 minor points to relay to you, that would improve things: - The valet app is annoying as I have to send my tel number more than once per day to log in and get a verification code, save then request a car. I am sure the valet can improve their app, so that once you are logged in it saves your details. - The carpets on my floor need better upkeep.

6/26/2018,43277,1.0,"Something is always going wrong at Centerra. When we moved into Centerra, we had a very poor experience. We moved in sight unseen and the apartment was horrible. Filthy, like it wasn't even maintenanced or cleaned  when the previous residents moved out. We decided to transfer to give the place another chance after voicing all of our concerns to the Manager, Hope. She stated that they'd just switched over management almost a year ago and that they were still working out kinks with vendors and the team she had . Nothing is consistently good or even okay for us at Centerra. When brought back up, Hope is great at sending rude or condescending email responses. Of course, people tend to have favorites and choose to like or dislike someone, but in a professional setting, you should never be bias and treat everyone with the same respect. 

Elevators constantly down forcing us to take the dirty stairs 20 floors up or down or causing us to be late to work or meetings. Hope seems to be great at pretending she's listening but doesn't bring any true results. Oh, and of course, there may be a response to this review trying to explain and give excuses the legit issues at Centerra and how they'd like me to contact the office... again, to resolve the multiple issues I have. The only good thing about Centerra is the 1 or 2 team members under her leadership who tend to produce results when they are able. Pets urinate all over the carpets and in the elevator(they've only cleaned once), garage spaces continuously have stains and garbage all over(only addressed once), the keyed entry systems from the garage to the building often dont work(addressed once), the grills are constantly filthy (they ""clean once a week""), water goes out almost once a month with no notice and other residents have had their property stolen. When there is a neighbor incident or dispute, you can definitely hear it in your apartment home. 

The lights in the ""Penthouse ""hallway took 3 months to fix... not any less... they claim they were waiting on a part all that time. I know from experience that most items can be ordered and delivered the same week. Worst case, something requires little more time with an anticipated date for arrival but required follow up. They aren't serious about maintaining the place. The windows in the ""Penthouse"" & everywhere else in the building is still filthy... you cant enjoy the view because there's a hazy dirty coat of filth clinging to the windows. These are complaints that others have had as well. I know it doesn't take over a year to secure a vendor. 

I believe that it is important to evaluate fairness and practicality in any reviews that I post. When considering that, I only find that there's truly no excuse for the unhappiness you experience as a resident at Centerra. There are 347 apartment homes in the building and 21 floors. Theres absolutely no reason for cleaning to be addressed once a week. No reason why theres no regular communication. Theres no way to even enjoy the amenity area with family without being kicked out because the space is reserved with no memo, notice or sign on the door. There are at least 6 regular team members that work in the office not including the floaters that are seen. I dont cant count how many maintenance team members and vendors I see daily. All of my complaints for Centerra are valid and theres no excuse for them not to have been addressed in a timely manner. A Community this size should be cleaned regularly and have weekend support. Policies should be enforced and residents should be happy with where they live. The building was constructed so beautifully. Its unfortunate that it isnt maintained. If we could have made the choice all over, we would have never moved to Centerra! More pictures to come.",0.0,Non-Certified,26.0,0.0,0.0
3/6/2006,38782,1.0,"My experience as a resident at the Fillmore Center has been not so impressive.At first, all was swell...the building seemed to be well maintained and the location was in close proximity to Club One fitness, Safeway, Blockbuster, and great dining. Any time I had a question, it was quickly attended to by someone in the resident services office. Laundry was onsite and cost about half as much as at the local laundramat.I knew from the beginning that the neighborhood was a little sketchy, but when I brought this up with the leasing agent before signing, I was told that the neighborhood was improving quite steadily and that with the security offered, there shouldn't be anything to worry about.After only 6 months of living at the Fillmore Center there have been multiple shootings right outside my building, not to mention the riots in the street. We are not talking about one or two people fighting.... I am talking about a full on gang BRAWL...40 people going at eachothers throats! In fact, I just heard5 or six gunshots outside my building (there are now 14 cop cars, 2 firetrucks, and a few ambulances right outside) which is what prompted me to write this article.However, that is simply part of living one block outside of the projects....not the fillmore centers fault...But here is what IS their fault. In the past month there has been 3 breakin attempts on my apartment. One of which happened while one of us was at home in the shower and they made off with a brand new laptop, a playstation, and a large ammount of money. I'm just thankful no one was hurt!I was thinking we must have been one of the first people who this has happened to considering the management had never brought it to our attention that breakins were a problem, but it seemed that anytime I shared our experience with other tenants, everyone seemed to have similar stories (break-in attempts, stolen property, etc).Yes I know I should have expected this being in this neighborhood, but instead of the Fillmore center sending warnings to tenants about frequent break-ins and thefts, all we ever seem to get notices about are utility price increases and construction going on accross the street. After pulling a lot of teeth we were able to convince courtesy patrol this is a huge issue and that residents should recieve notices on how to make their homes a safer place to be.If I had the choice to do it all again, I would never have moved here. My recommendation is to talk to the police about the ammount of violence in this neighborhood before you even talk to the leasing office here.

It took 2 weeks before management would even bother to sit down with me to discuss the break in. (2) My car was broken into. (3) My car was towed. (4) I developed severe asthma due to the smoker on the balcony below me. There is no insulation between the inside and outside and I was forced to ingest cigarette smoke 24/7. I tried working things out with the smoker, and with maintenance, and finally with management. I brought dctr notes to management requesting a reasonable accomodation, but none was offered. I had no choice but to break my lease, if I didn't, I would have ended up in the hospital or worse. No reasonable accomodation was offered by management, and the cost of breaking my lease was as follows: $2100 early termination fee pay back 5% discount $250 steam clean apartment, a professional cleaning with receipt is required 2 x $1350, after I turned in my 60 day notice I had to vacate and did not live there the last 60 days. If I had stayed in the unit those 60 days, I would have ended up in the hospital.

6/15/2018,43266,5.0,"We moved into Ink Block around a year ago and have been so pleased with our time here. We worked with Rebekah from the leasing office to schedule our initial visit and then again to finalize our lease. She was honest, professional, and so welcoming! We had visited 3-4 other apartment complexes around South End and our interaction with her, as well as Ink Block's facilities and location, made the decision incredibly easy for us to commit to Ink Block.

In regards to location, Ink Block is less than a 10 minute walk to Tufts Medical Center, a few minutes from Chinatown, and is located beside/on top of Whole Foods! We barely had to drive/lyft anywhere because walking was so easy and safe. 

The apartment we stayed in was BEAUTIFUL. So much natural night - we barely turned on any lights during the daytime. It's very clean and modern, with one of the most amazing views of Boston we have ever seen. 

We've seen the new management take a much more proactive role in creating a community vibe in the building. There are always fun social events/activities at Ink Block going on every month! My husband and I are pretty busy with work/studies, but it's always interesting for us to read about all of the cool things happening in the community every week. 

Perhaps the biggest thing that made a difference for us were the staff at Ink Block. Deshawn at concierge always greeted us at the front door with a warm smile and kept up with our lives as well. He is incredibly hard working, sweet, and friendly. Literally everyone at concierge was like that! Living in Boston can sometimes be overwhelming, but the folks at Ink Block truly made us feel like we were with family. 

Special shout out to Rebekah from leasing and EVERYONE at concierge who made our time at Ink Block so wonderful. Thank you all so much.

4/12/2019,43567,4.0,"I found this apartment building online, before moving to Chicago. Beyond the website of the property management company I did not find much more information. I was a bit worried about whether the apartment etc. would meet my expectations, since I did not find real independent reviews before signing the contract and had no chance to visit before. But I must say that I was more than positively surprised. The apartment and the furniture I rented with it were all in super shape and exactly as agreed upon before. The staff (both the administration, maintenance team, and the security personnel) is always accessible, sweet and super helpful. I immediately felt very much at home and at peace. The location of Vue53 at lively 53rd Street is awesome and very close to the University of Chicago. I can only warmly recommend renting an apartment in Vue53. The only little complaint I would have is the heating/ventilation system: it often produces quite a strong draft in the unit, is hard to regulate/adjust and pretty loud.

My concern is that I will retire from my job in Oct. 06 and move out of the area. I need to know that I have a place to live until then and not have to keep on moving from place to place. She said that I could stay in 1 and move into one of the renovated apartments when they are ready, but she couldn't say how much more it will cost me. I heard it could be up 30% more than what I'm paying now.  She said if I moved into building 2 I could potentialy get kicked out again before Oct 06.

The building is new with modern styling -- dark hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, tile in the kitchen. The floorplans are square (making the space more usable then several other buildings in the area) with decent natural light. Frustrating is that there is always a long wait for the elevator (75% of the time only 2 of the 3 elevators are operational and a building of this size should certainly have 4).

The gated campus is marked with lap pools and waterfalls and offers high-speed Internet access and parking.Faced with a burglary once every four days, the center's management has written to Mayor Gavin Newsom and Police Chief Heather Fong, appealing for more cops and accusing police of being slow to respond to the problem.Residents at the well-appointed complex -- which fetches $1,400 a month for a one-bedroom apartment and $2,500 a month for a two-bedroom townhouse -- are seeing their doors pried open and personal possessions plundered. ""Many of our residents have lost high-value and irreplaceable sentimental items,"" said general manager Steve Boyack, in the letter to Newsom. ""A police officer responds after great delay, takes a quick report and leaves. Little or no investigation takes place at all.""The center's management, which provides its own security patrols of the complex, did not return calls seeking comment.Police have not been lax investigating the case and have two suspects they believe are responsible for many of the crimes Sgt. Neville Gittens said.Cops planned to set up a meeting with residents and building management to discuss the problem and to advise residents of safety precautions, such as locks and landscaping, which can discourage burglaries, Gittens said.""There is concern. We are working on it and we are trying to work with the management, residents, everybody involved, to put a stop to it.""Boyack said The Fillmore Center faced lawsuits from residents over the burglaries and suffered the costs of damaged doors and locks.The crime along Fillmore Street and how it's affected life in the Fillmore Center is a sore point among many of the residents, if a perusal of anonymous postings on a city apartment-finder Web site is any judge.Tenants bemoan chronic violence in the surrounding neighborhood, such as the killing of Chris Johnson in the Safeway opposite the complex in May.",0.0,Non-Certified,45.0,0.0,0.0

3/24/2018,43183,1.0,"Let me start by saying I lived at the point of silver spring for one year. Please read the reviews and the Unrecommended section before deciding to move in, there are REASONS for the 1 star here on the yelp.

PROS: Apartments are a good size, walking distance to metro, downtown silver spring : whole food, ulta, movie theater and other shops and that's about it really.

CONS: 
MANAGEMENT non existence, emails are ignored, incompetent, unethical, unprofessional and plain rude. When ask to speak with property manager the response is she's not here today. 
SAFTEY- that's my major concern, the area and the apartment complex is not safe it was a nightmare, concierge let anybody in, there was a robbery, gun shot, break in in the parking where tires get stolen ( images waking up in the morning to go to work to find out your wheels are gone (Thankfully that did not happen to me) i moved my car to the public parking on the same street for a year, since I mentioned the parking please be aware the gate is always open making it the major reason for break in. Management is aware of it and didn't bother.
MARIJUANA- hallways and apartment will always stink management aware of it and sent email Only ( emails REALLY)
WASHER DRYER - are broke. Sent requests to be fix and my request shows close.
PEST AND MICE INFESTATION- I was on bi weekly schedule till the day I moved and the problem still exist.
GYM- most of the equipment not working.
TRASH ROOM- one word GROSS. People will place the trash on the floor also the trash company didn't take the trash for months( can you images what the whole apartment smells like that's A DISGRACE) 
PETS- I'm an animal lover but this place feels like a kennel a lot of dog owner do not pick up after their dogs also they will take them to undesignated pet area it will clearly state that.
PLUMING issue I will have maintenance coming in at any time there was one incident where the came in when I just got off the shower thankfully I had my robe on I screamed the maintenance guy goy scars and apologize and said the management asked him to come in no heads up (unbelievable) that will give you an idea on how incompetent they are.
NOISE- constant noise from your inconsiderate neighbors when complain to management guess what? Nothing is done. Walls are thin you will hear everything. 

I take pride in the place I live in and I was embarrassed to bring anyone in and felt my hard working money going to wast. It came to a point I was counting the days till move out and I'm glad I did.

7/17/2016,42568,5.0,"This positive review may be somewhat unique in that my job has required me to move every 2 years for over 20 years - so my sample size in reviewing apartments may be a bit broader than the average customer.

Before I discuss a few specifics, the following subsections are heavily influenced by the management team - of which I cannot say enough.  The team (during my occupancy) led by Tara, and staffed by Jennifer and Olivia are nothing short of exceptional.   Responsive, friendly and they truly care about their tenants.....a striking difference from some of the other local places (100, 700, 909, Lexmark) where I was made to wait, put off, delayed - even in simply viewing an apartment.

A few specifics:  
- Infrastructure:  Fantastic.  Modern, new and in a constant state of optimal condition.  The maintenance team led by George, and consisting of Mauro and Henry - are timely, responsive, and professional.  A first class team.

- Concierge.  I mostly dealt with Jerimiah at the front desk, an energetic young man who strives to provide stellar / friendly service.  However over my year there - I can affirm the front desk staff works collectively, communicates effectively and all were fantastic at responding to occupant needs...parcels, mail, etc.  As an avid traveler, I equate their service to a concierge at a 5 star resort hotel.

- Gym.  Wonderful.  Best in the area, better than 909, 700, 100 and anything at Waterfront - I personally went and reviewed all - this was the tipping point for me.  Bluetooth, wifi - great little gym.

- Amenities....roof top pool, views of the capital, monument, courtyard with a large outdoor TV...BBQs everywhere, fireplaces, pool table, wonderful mail room / library to enjoy coffee - read a book....FREE coffee from a high tech machine (READ NOT KRUPPS)..Everything from tea to hot cocoa and custom coffees...A nice plus.
Location - Close to metro and you can uber anywhere is DC for no more than $12 (non-surge).  Period.

Extras:  Management team coordinates 'tenant appreciation' events - Thanksgiving, December Holidays, Cinco De Mayo, etc....hosted with a complementary bar and pupus - always nicely done.

Bottom Line:  Loved this place - job took me away - or I would have stayed ....forever.  Cheers Parc Riverside.",0.0,Non-Certified,30.0,0.0,1.0

Where do I start... moved into a studio for $1556 ended up paying close to $1800 per month...how do you ask... utility chargers changed drastically each month even though i was barely ever home, even got billed for 2 cars by mistake.

The lack of respect for the building by some of the recent resident additions (and their no/low class friends/visitors) makes me speculate deep discounts were offered for some to afford, or mommy and daddy are footing the bill. I regularly see people allowing their dogs to relieve themselves right on the cylindrical pillar directly outside the Kinzie door and even on the door mat. There is no better was to come home that the smell of hot piss outside the back door which is baking in the sun as it begins to set. Pointing out their fault usually results in ?they had to go bad??my response?then get home sooner, or get a dog walker -------. Common sense?something lacking with these folks. Quite a few of my friends in the building have decided not to renew their leases and are moving out very shortly. The place has seen a drop in class that places it on par with an expensive college dorm room. While there are numerous professionals in the building (and on my floor) which are a stark contrast to that statement, the fact still remains that countless amenities have been restricted from when we first signed a lease, and new rules are constantly instituted as a direct result of these ""residents"", and in most cases their stupid visitors/friends. It is not fair to those that do have respect for the building. When I first moved in, I could go down to the movie theater and watch Formula 1 in the early morning (sometimes at 12a-3a?depending on the location of the race)?now that is a far distant memory since some folks cannot control urges (you know what I am referring to) to act out & be stupid...and there are now time restrictions on when it is open. The building should require letters of recommendation...similar to the requirements of a professional city club speaking to the character of the potential resident. Also contact prior landlords and find out if there were any problems with the potential tenant before allowing them to sign a lease. I know for a fact this is not done...they only run a background check via ON-SITE MANAGER INC which checks the Experian credit file and runs a criminal background check. Another requirement should be that only the potential resident can submit an application for a lease. Mom/Dad or any other 3rd party cannot co-sign for a potential resident or lease an apartment on behalf of someone else. This would alleviate quite a bit of the immaturity. I know for a fact (Billy Vocitas?one of the leasing agents advised this shortly after we signed our lease) that there are quite a few folks that did not get in the building on their own merit, and had someone co-sign for them. If you allow this...you are opening the door to problems....red flags should go off when someone cannot get in the building on their own...and rather than suggesting they get a co-signer, tell them sorry and they should look somewhere else to ensure the safety and security of the community.",1.0,Silver,54.0,2.0,0.0

2/23/2018,43154,5.0,"I've been living at The Shelby for about a year now, and previously lived here in 2015/6 before moving out for a short while. When I was looking for a one-bedroom apartment, I stopped by to see what they had available and was lucky enough to find one in my price range. I love the aesthetic of the complex and the apartments.
Since I've been here for awhile, I've experienced all three management companies - Bozzuto when the complex first opened, Greystar after, and then Bozzuto again, which is the current management company. While there is no perfect apartment complex, I like the changes and experience of the current management. It took a little while for them to get settled, but they offer work out classes twice a week, happy hours, and resident events. While I wish they offered more happy hours (I was spoiled when Bozzuto was first here - they had Thirsty Thursday every week), what they do offer is great. The management staff also made an effort to get to know me, although I think part of that is because my dog is adorable and a complete ham. 
The walls are a bit thin at times, it's easy to hear other residents in the backyard area when I have my windows open, and amenity fees were increased ($50-$60 a month for garage parking, $30 for valet trash, etc.), overall I think it's a great place to live and recommend it for anyone looking for a place in the area.

The suffering of people here is manifest in their haggard faces and hostile attitudes. In many ways, it's like a concentration camp: rife with violence, human waste, and infestation. Assaults and non-functioning elevators define our daily existence; the roaches, mice, and other vermin are the witnesses to our struggle to simply live. Although the police, health inspectors, and other emergency personnel are here constantly, you still slip on urine in the stairwells and awake to screams and the loudest hits of San Salvador. Dogs, cats, and other pets are forbidden, which is a shame. A worse shame is that having thousands of inch-long roaches in your apartment is apparently not a problem. You might get 24 hours notice for them to enter to spray DDT on all your clothes, but more likely your notice will be a non-English speaking crew opening your door at the crack of dawn. The staff are hostile to everyone, and security only hassles you if you live here. The twelfth floor becomes a swamp after more than two days of rain, the worst cave-in always being right near the trash room. Some of the more direct residents will rub their swollen members on anything warm and moving, so beware. Speaking Spanish won't make life here better, but it will help with conflicts in the dungeon-like laundry room. Ethiopian is also useful. I get less hot water than a college dorm in Baghdad, but most people here don't suffer for the lack because they bathe monthly, if that.

While many properties today are doing extra things to get your business, this property appears genuine with the many events they have for the residents. We have an amazing community room where they have Taco Tuesdays, painting parties, wine nights, pop-up shops, and great meals hosted and prepared by some great local chefs. The events are always enjoyable not just because they wine and dine you, but because you have not only the opportunity but also the pleasure to get to know your neighbors. Everyone is very respectful by keeping noise to a minimum in the building and the beautiful array of dogs at the property don't hurt either.

Back to the staff; every encounter from the maintenance team to the conceirge to the community manager has been nothing but positive and all without prompting. They go above to always ensure that your time here is pleasant like if you were at an upscale hotel but with all of the comforts of home. This is truly a great place to live. Jasimon (leasing agent) has got to be one of the most engaged employees at the property who makes you feel welcomed and valued. She and the other leasing staff take pride in putting together the activities for us and always reminds us of upcoming events. It wouldn't be fair to not mentioned the awesomeness of Kyle, Elizabeth and Chris. They all ROCK!! Lastly, I have to send a shout out to the maintenance team that I've engaged with.

The side door on Wewatta and the area around it wreaks of dog urine. Maintenance cleans the area often, but right after they clean it ten more dogs have ruined their efforts.

11/28/2017,43067,1.0,"I lived in this community for over 3 years, of which nearly 6 months overlapped with the change in management from Red Peak to Greystar. I chose to move explicitly because of issue noticed by other residents in these reviews, namely little to no attention to upkeep of the facilities or concern for residents under a facade of politeness. This includes: broken elevators/fob access breakdowns took much longer to repair, outside doors being propped open, packages left in the foyer or hallway instead of being managed or kept by the leasing office, graffiti in the elevators. I even had a neighbor literally making so much noise my floors would shake (the building is wood construction); even with multiple calls to security the management office ignored me. 

My move out / lease termination process was by far the biggest fiasco I've ever been through in my 10 years of leasing (and I have lived in NYC).  Cover your tracks in email with every conversation with the office management; even then, I have had to hire an attorney to deal with their incompetence in writing/reading their own correspondence.   Yes, an attorney. Specifically: I was given my lease renewal with less than 60 days notice; when I finally received my new lease, the email I received had a specific date by which to provide a response. I provided a date to move out within 2 weeks, well within the timeframe that was written. When I had to change my move-out date a few days later due to the worsening conditions in the building (again, all within the window I was given by Greystar in their email), I was told I now have to pay EXTRA rent for not providing notice within 60 days, even though I was complying with their written instructions! I have in writing that they had officially entered the new move-out date into their system and that I was paid in full when I returned my keys but they are still charging me for additional rent for days when I was not a leaseholder nor in the building.  At this point, I'm involving an attorney because Greystar is withholding my security deposit for 6 months past move-out AND threatening to mark my credit report with nonpayment of rent for time I was no longer a leaseholder; Greystar staff won't resolve this peacefully or settle. 

P.S. If you live here now, kiss $100 of your security deposit goodbye to extra fees Greystar will charge you no matter how well you clean.",1.0,Silver,54.0,1.0,0.0

The amenities are superb and range from a 24-hr fitness center, dog runs, rooftop lounge with incredible sights of downtown as well as grills, games, tv, and couches, a conference room is available to reserve for free, and a general ""party"" room is available to reserve for free that comes with kitchen appliances. For out-of-town guests, Coppins Well offers tenants the chance to reserve an apartment unit for a nightly fee. The location is second-to-none, being situated on First Hill with easy access to bus lines, ethnic restaurants, Capitol Hill down the road for a lively night scene, and walking distance to anything in the downtown region. Parking is the only issue at Coppins Well. Although a parking garage under the units is available for tenants to reserve a spot, it often has a waiting list.

No loud parties or noises in the whole time.

I have seen some reviews, with which I have to respectfully disagree. There was no pest problem in my apartment at all. It was simply too new for that. There was really no problem with heating and cooling it either. I used the gym everyday, it is good enough for an average person, if you are a professional athlete, my hats off to you, but you need to go to a professional gym.

I recently visited the area for another apartment, since I needed a bigger one and TrueNorth didn't have what I was looking for. I can attest that at the time of this writing, their price is more than reasonable among similar buildings.

I had a great experience at the end of my lease as well. Inspection was made in a day and full refund. I can't agree with older reviews about problems with deposit refund, but that is perhaps due to the new management and the awesome work of the officers there.

The building is gorgeous and I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. A few shout outs...

The leasing team was incredibly courteous and supportive. Evan Fried, a member of the leasing team, stayed after hours to show me different apartments when I was in a state of indecision. Despite the number of tours he had each day he made me feel valued. All of the leasing members, including the amazing Erica, took the time to know my name and listen to my concerns. They went over floor map and over floor map, again and again with exceptional patience. 

Additionally, the concierge team is the best I have experienced. Antonia the head concierge and Kendra, another concierge, deserve shoutouts. They are the warmest, sweetest human beings. Both take the time to help you whether it be borrowing a screw driver, printing a document or helping me when I got locked out of my apartment. They know the building inside and out. Antonia even went out of her way to help me give a grand tour to my visiting friend. She didn't need to do it but that is her, going above and beyond her job description.

The maintenance team led by Matt is also outstanding. They respond promptly and are knowledgeable. James, also on the maintenance team bounds about the building filled with joy. He took the time to help me with my fob when it was acting finicky. It is so clear they care and I love how promptly they respond.

The custodial team has blown me away.  A story that exemplifies this: day two of moving in I have lots of boxes related to my move outside my door. I leave them outside my door to take down after I finish constructing my desk. A few minutes later I hear a gentle knock. Jorge from the custodial team was walking by and offered to take them down for me. ""Are you sure? You don't have to,"" I tell him but he insists. 

Finally, the amenities of this building are top notch. Gorgeous roof deck, coffee shop/bar IN your apartment building, stainless steel appliances, infinity pool (coming soon...). The building accepts UPS pick up and drop off. I also love the little things like the state of the art exercise machines with built in fans, cellphone service in elevators and how easy it is to recycle boxes (just leave in the trash room). The only thing I wish they had was a community library, alas...

It's annoying that the pool is only open for 3 months of the year - primarily because it requires a lifeguard. So that means you can't use the hot tub in the colder months. There is construction of a building next door that's noisy and will block off lower level views. Concierge and maintenance staff are friendly, responsive, professional and helpful. Can't say enough good things about the concierge. We left on vacation and one of the concierges went up and checked on/fed our cats for us (we asked her)! She was a godsend. They are trustworthy and respond to emails and try to help. The floors are frustrating, they show all the hair and dirt since they are dark and show everything. I think it has an amazing location: the walkability is great. 2-5 minutes to coffee, restaurants, and grocery shopping. Its right next to the bus stop into NYC and a 10 minute walk to the ferry. It's also 5 minutes from the rail that goes to Hoboken/Downtown. The area is very safe and the river walk in front of the building is nice. It's also a short drive away to proper shopping, movie theatre, hair cuts, target...etc. without having to go into the city for. It's nice enough to enjoy, aside from some downfalls. It's a good temporary place to stay, but very expensive. The gym is decent, but sometimes gets crowded. Be very careful as any damage will likely cost a lot of money to ""repair/fix/clean"". This goes for walls, stainless steel appliances, floors...etc. The community events are fun and nice - they usually provide free food and drinks and neighbors actually get to know each other. The common areas are very clean and always smell nice. You have to take cardboard down to the first floor but oh well. It's not that bad - the trash shoots on your floor are VERY convenient. We have our car in the garage and I feel it is very safe there - it's expensive to park, but for me it's worth it to know it's ""safer"" and shielded from the elements. Sometimes you can hear people in the hallway because there is a slight gap at the bottom of the door. Buy a door gap cover off of amazon for $10 and that noise will be gone! It also helps stop escaping air. Sometimes if a neighbor has base too high you can hear some music/vibrations. They have always been respectful at quiet hours (past 10pm), and usually don't last long or are very often. During the summer months when the pool is open, it can tend to get a little noisy from kids and people hanging out, as well as the pool itself makes some loud water noises. It's not too obnoxious, but you may notice it if you keep your windows open. Keep in mind --> you are signing up to live in an apartment. Noise is going to happen!

And it took 6 months for the building to deal with the fact that my ceiling was leaking. 6 months of holes in my ceiling and water falling on me.

But the worst was the garbage. The garbage shoot was constantly backed up, which resulted in piles of garbage bags piled up outside the chute.

We had no previous knowledge of the city, the neighborhoods, etc.  We spent hours online, apartment hunting, emailing, calling, taking virtual tours to find the ""perfect apartment.""  We definitely found it here at The Yard.  

Prior to our arrival, communication from The Yard's leasing office was instantaneous.  Each time we emailed with questions, we received a response very quickly (most times within a minute or two)!  Sam, one of the Leasing Staff, took the time to go up to a couple units, take photos of those units (along with the view of the surroundings) and email them to us.  Having that opportunity to see the actual unit versus a floor-plan helped solidify our decision to rent here.  

Upon arrival into Portland, the Leasing Staff had everything ready for us to move-in.  The move-in process was simple with their oversized elevators and wide hallways.  With that being said, the best part of living here thus far are the residents.  Everyone we've met in an elevator or in the community lounge has been exceptionally friendly and welcoming.  We're gathering that this friendliness is the Portland way of life, but our first interactions here set the bar high.  

The units are very unique.  If you're looking for a modern approach to city living, this is the place.  We were slightly concerned about the kitchen space before arrival, however we were pleasantly surprised with the large amount of cabinet space.  Our balcony is located on the west side of the building, so we have a view of the Willamette River and downtown PDX.  You honestly can't find a better view of Portland.

When we were moving from out of state to Denver, we felt that this would be perfect- the location is great but there are 20 other buildings in the same location that are less expensive and offer the same amenities with a better management team. 

They are marketed as a non-smoking building but it is impossible to escape the constant smell of smoke both cigarette and marijuana.

AirBnBs frequent this location and are usually booked by bachelor parties so you are greeted in the morning with passed out ""guests"" in the elevators and loud parties at night. 

The maintenance team usually has to come back multiple times to fix a problem and then wont fix it at all. 

The parking garage is constantly inundated with people who shouldn't park there and management refuses to ticket or tow and will tell you ""you live downtown get used to it.""

The management will tell you that they are trying to fix this by walking the halls and sending e mails- but that is the extent of what they will do. We were told that there is nothing to be done. They do not uphold their end of the lease and will charge you huge amounts to get out of yours.  The resident turnover rate is huge for good-reason!

3/30/2012,40998,4.0,"I've lived in a lot of cities, with a huge arc in my lifetime salary, and I can say that some of the apartments I've lived in really pale in comparison to Loring Park City Apartments. I've lived in a few places, however, that compare (and then out-strip) to the well-heeled feel of the place. If you want to live in a place that encourages neighbor relationships, you're probably better off with the brownstones around the block, because you can't help but bump into people if there's no elevator. Weeks have gone by at a time where I haven't seen a soul in the hallways of Loring Park, (the hallway lighting is a little creepy and adds to ""The Shining"" effect of the long, fire-door lined interior halls) but I've certainly heard the collegiate population partying, or someone's jittery dog at their door. However, once you get into your own space... The apartments are nicely appointed, good fixtures and quality cupboards in the kitchen and bathrooms. Since the construction is fairly new, not a lot of complaints here. The courtyard is nicely maintained, where kids play and adults grill out. The 24-hr fitness center looks out into the courtyard at ground level, which can be a little disconcerting when you're trying to eke out that last set on the shoulder press, and someone in their living room is staring at you through the bay doors. The management allows dogs. Fantastic. However, human beings don't always get the concept of training and picking up after their dogs. This can happen at all apartment complexes, and is really the only 'pet peeve' (and that of the previous tenant in my unit, as well), as grass is limited, and that means you have to watch your step coming out the stairs. The management team itself is a little ... well, they're nice enough, but they're also a little weird. Which is fine, it's just not an environment that encourages me to pop my head in the door on my way to work, or keep them abreast as to my comings and goings. But they put out coffee, sugar and real creamer each morning, and that's nice, if you leave for work after 10 in the morning. Parking is, as it normally is in downtown, unfortunate. And being close to the school and city park means even meaner street police and metered spaces are limited. However, the 3 figures LPCA require of you to park underground (with car wash access) is equal to that of the ABC ramps, and at least my work gets me a discount for those. Other things not included in the (nearly $2-3 per sq. ft, on average) rent are utilities (trash, etc.), and the in-unit washer and dryer (app. $600 extra per year). What you're paying for, essentially: the decor within the building (IKEA mirrors and attractive furnishings in the minute foyer, conference areas and 'community lounge'), the extras (24-hr fitness center, sauna, courtyard fireplace and grills) and the security (key-fob entrances, code-in delivery, metal doorjams). If these are things that matter to you, then, by all means, pay for them and enjoy your nicely-appointed apartment. If they don't really matter to you, then pay 25% of the asking price on Loring's 2-bedroom, 1-bath and move into the 4th floor walk-up of the brownstones on the other side of the park. You have to ask yourself what's most important to you, what you can afford and what you're willing to live with when it comes to apartment-hunting. With the price tag well over what you'd pay for a mortgage in some instances, you would expect a little more ""luxury"" appointments, or a more classy interior edifice, or a slightly more upscale management team. Then again, I can be extremely particular in my diligence and I'm no stranger to looking beneath the surface. Neighbors come and go, management turns over new teams and parking is always a pain in the downtown area.

The good: 
Hardwood (nice laminate) floors in the living space, comfortable and durable carpet in the bedrooms. 

While they are not stainless steel, the kitchen appliances are still very modern and upgraded. 

Maintenance staff is so wonderful. 

Most of the front desk staff is wonderful (besides a few grouchy/lazy people). 

Location location location. Close to the CTA red line, north ave bus, halsted bus, PLUS tons of stores. Perfect for getting errands done. 

The amenities are perfect. Great pool and gym. The grills are nice too.  


The bad:
Parking is super expensive in the building. We parked across the street in the lot attached to the british school for half the price. 

We don't have a dog, but we love animals so we did not mind them in the building at all. The biggest problem was that a lot of owners allow their dogs to pee in the hallways and the building does not clean properly so the stench is kind of permanent. Gross. 

The kitchen sink does not have a garbage disposal and often gets backed up. 

The shower drain also often gets backed up. 

!!!!!!!!!!!!! Most IMPORTANTLY - they raised our rent 23% after one year of living there!!!!!!!!! Unfortunately there are no laws in Chicago that protect tenants. We had to move to a smaller unit since we wanted to stay in the building.  Not cool. Be aware of this before signing a lease.

5/11/2017,42866,1.0,"I had a window spontaneously shatter (!?) and ended up in a protracted week long feud with multiple levels of Windsor's management. I was repeatedly told that the damage was caused 'by an internal projectile', as they were unwilling to directly state that they believed I broke it.

I took time off work to find lawyers and eventually tracked down a forensic chemist who pointed out several reasons why it was a faulty window before Cirrus/Windsor backed down. The only form of apology I received for the amazing exploding window, vague financial threats, corporate phone tag, and vacation days spent talking to expensive professionals was something along the lines of 'we appreciate your patience.'

The leasing office here failed me on two other occasions:
* Once I woke up to find construction workers in my apartment with no notice whatsoever.
* I had to escalate to corporate in order to convey that having construction workers enter my apartment more than 3 times in a week to fix a cosmetic issue I did not care about was excessive.

If they tell you that construction noise is temporary, sure it is - if you plan on living here for more than 5+ years. Otherwise, expect construction noise when you move in all the way to the day you move out - it certainly was on both ends of my year and a half at Cirrus. It wasn't even limited to daylight hours when I left - heavy roadwork was being done nearby every night for weeks. Even if the noise doesn't bother you, it can and will randomly tie up any of the nearby roads and make any sort of vehicular travel frustrating and painful.

The trash chute is blocked up 30-50% of the time, and some of the residents will instead leave broken glass and leaking garbage bags in piles next to the trash chute door. Sometimes they'll even hang their trash bags on the handle, so you have to move trash out of the way if you want to properly dispose of yours.

I do want to say that while the leasing office is terrible, the concierge staff is fantastic. I had a snafu or two with my movers during move out and although I didn't end up needing too much help from the concierge in the end, they were ready and eager to help us figure things out.

Yesterday, I went to ask information about a one bedroom plus a den apartment, i have to mention the woman who attended me was gentle, we were talking and she told about the opportunity to apply to MPDU, so I arrived home and began to search for information about it, in fact my husband qualifies with the maximum income $69000, so we decided to apply to this program. My husband is the only one working right now, he is giving me the great opportunity to raise my child, now my son is almost 3, so he needs his own space, so we need a bigger apartment and the prices here in Washington are crazy, is a like a mafia, so MPDU is a good opportunity for us as family, since now we didn't use MPDU, all these 3 years we payed the full price for an apartment. Today we went to Fenwick, my husband came home earlier, we went to talk with the leasing consultant, or what we thought was the leasing agent. We saw the apartments but when we mentioned that we wanted to apply for the MPDU in that second their attitude changed completely, not even the consultant attended us, he only sent information to the concierge. This really bothered and disappointed me, my husband as a second plan was ready to pay the full price in spite of not getting an apartment with MPDU, but we expected to talk with the person responsible for leasing and know which steps we have to follow, they lost a customer only for their behavior. We are so lucky we can pay for a full price apartment and receive good attention but what happened with the people that have minimum incomes?, they received an attention like this??? Its not fair!!!

Elliot and all of the maintenance staff were friendly and truly cared about taking care of you if you needed anything done in your apartment, at any hour of the day or night. The reasons I decided to move were: 1) I thought I wanted to own and build some equity. 2) The live theater directly below my apartment which had been vacant for years had just been sold as a jazz club and the previews showed me how loud living there would become. I'm extremely sensitive to noise and all of the MPDU's were on the floor above the theater so moving to another unit was not an option for me, financially. I ended up purchasing a condo and I already hate it. The management I have now is horrible and I miss living at The Whitney every day.

So I highly recommend The Whitney to anyone who can afford to live away from the theater section or who doesn't mind the steady rumble of bass from downstairs (I almost never heard noise from my neighbors). Some people may not be as bothered by the noise as I was and if you can deal with that, The Whitney is hands down the best apartment building in Bethesda.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,1.0

I mean, how can you not love a place that offers you cheez-its and water when you pop in on a first visit! So, initial thoughts: amazement. I moved from another local apartment complex and this is a total 180-degrees from where I moved. It's new, secure and inviting. I'm a single guy so I picked a one bedroom apartment. It has a HUGE master bedroom and a decent sized living room. I enjoy cooking, so the fact it has a nice sized kitchen is also a huge perk! It does feel a bit more ""homey"" than any place I've checked so far. The other residents I've encountered have been very nice. I mean, I suppose different places draw different crowds. A lot of the folks I've seen are either students, young professionals or military. It's a good mix. The parking garage is awesome, with some extra spaces available for purchase if needed (which is uber important). This is the first time I've ever experienced valet trash. So that's new (and weird) to me. It's kinda convenient, though. Now, as far as noise goes. I have yet to hear any of my neighbors. I am in an apartment that sits on Rt 1. (see the first review for info on the building layout). So there is general road noise. I can handle the general road noise. When watching TV, I can pretty much tune it out. At night, I flip on my Dohm Sound Conditioner and it drowns out any noise outside -- so it's not a big deal for me. The place is also pet friendly. I love dogs, so I've seen plenty of them around. That's enjoyable for me. This is a ""green"" facility. So it does have solar panels to help reduce the power bill and the water saving toilets (two button). The hallways are lined with motion sensors so you feel like you're in the freezer section because only 1/2 the lights are on until the sensor picks up you're going down the hall.

4/4/2017,42829,2.0,"We lived at greenlake village for a short 10 months, it was great at first but things started to go down hill quickly. 

Small annoyances:
1) You pay $125 for parking, which living in this part of greenlake is a necessity. It's not assigned which isn't a big deal, but there is also no separation or regulation from where the PCC customers can park. So imagine dealing with the annoying grocery store parking lot hell experience every time you needed to go somewhere. 

2) as mentioned the walls are paper thin, we could hear everything around us. Our apartment also faced the little red hen, so we had the joy of hearing ""wagon wheel"" and bar fights till 2 am every night. Again we didn't have a huge problem with this as we work nights. 

3) the apartments have little to no ventilation in the summer time, and the windows open with vegas rules. It was hot as hell for a solid three months. 

4) I got stuck in the south elevator with another tenant and had to pry open the doors ourselves as there was no one in the office at 3pm on a Tuesday. This elevator broke pretty consistently through out our stay. Given you can't access the garage from the actual apartment building staircases this became a big pain. 

5) online rent pay is often wonky and out of order. 

Larger issues

1) They began a resurfacing project in the garage with little to no notice given to the tenants of the building. This cut the PCC parking in half, so they we allowed to park in resident parking (which we pay $125 a month for). On top of that they had it fairly poorly ventilated during the entire process, so the south building had a pretty awful fume smell for a few weeks. I have asthma so I mentioned to the building that it would have been nice to know about this prior so I could find somewhere else to stay and never received a respond. We were told this process would only take a couple weeks and ended up taking two months. Never offered a discount on our parking or really any info on it at all. 

2) closer to our move out date someone had entered our apartment with no prior approval or notification. They left the front door UNLOCKED! The only reason we knew someone had been in there was our bedroom door was open(we keep it closed to keep our dog out when we're not home), the closet door was open and the door was unlocked. We considered maybe it wasn't them, but we had cash sitting on the counter untouched along with other fairly pricey items around the apartment. I went to the office and spoke with Terry (maintenance super) who was great about it and came to change the locks, though I'm convinced it wasn't another member of the office. It's hard to believe someone would come into our apartment and not take the obvious stuff. 

3) For our last months rent we were given a prorated amount to pay, we paid it on time and didn't hear anything else about it. We just received our move out letter and are being charged $175 in late fees and back logged utilities. I reached out to the office and they said there's nothing they can tell me about it and it's all handled through alliance. Tried to call them and have yet to get through to our ""rep"". I never received an email or any sort of correspondence that we had anything left over. We're also being nickled and dimed for some other stuff that we were told we wouldn't need to worry about, but after reading other reviews it seems to be their MO. 

Luckily with our deposit we only ""owe"" $120 and we've decided just to pay it and not deal with these people ever again.

12/13/2016,42717,1.0,"Oh where do I even begin.... 

This used to be such a nice complex that I recommended to all of my friends however; The new management company that took over The Shelby is certainly a deal breaker for the entire complex regardless of the amenities it offers.  

I have been more than patient with this new management company. I did not want to mention anything about them while they were getting their feet wet but, they've been here for almost a year now. 

The management company has issues with the parking garage, packages, and maintenance requests. I will explain below. 

Parking Garage - while the Shelby was managed by Bozzuto we were able to get parking passes very easily for guest via their online portal. Now we have to go to the front desk with information about the vehicle during their business hours. I wouldn't mind doing this however - if you don't know your guest license plate number they will not issue you the pass. I would understand this if they tracked the license plates however they don't. They just write it on the slip to put into the vehicle. It's absolutely not necessary. Also, if you need a parking permit for longer than 3 days it cost an additional $5. I had a guest staying for four days so I inquired on how to pay for the $5 fee and the response was ""I'm not sure but, I can only give you a parking pass for three days."" ..... seriously?! You have this ridiculous rule and you don't even know how you enforce it. Give me a break. The parking garage also decided to have everyone go and return their old parking passes and now theyve gone to issuing the old parking passes again. This management company has no idea what they're doing with these parking garage rules. 

Also - the complex will tell you that they can only issue a parking permit while they're opened but they don't even stay open for their posted hours of operation. I went to the front desk today at 6pm and there was no one to be found. I went today at 630 and again - no one to be found and light out. The sign says they're opened until 7pm. 

Packages - be careful getting your packages sent to your place of residence. We will get notifications from the management company saying that there is a package that has arrived yet when we go to collect it, it has magically disappeared. They come up with EVERY excuse in the book about why your package has disappeared after they've checked it in. I've since learned you just have to ask them to check for it 3 times before they pull it out of the 8x10 locked room for packages. If you have more than one package and you KNOW you have more than one package there they will tell you they've ""accidentally logged in two packages but rest assured it's only one."" Sometimes tracking numbers will say that they've delivered packages and if you go to inquire about the status at the front desk they'll tell you ""shipping companies sometimes record that information early."" 

Maintenance requests - I have now submitted two maintenance request under this management company. Both seemed to be pretty simple jobs. One - I need a light bulb replaced in the bathroom. 
Two - the ice maker stopped working. 

The first request was made 4 times over the course of two weeks. Every time we would check to see when someone was coming they would say ""no request was put in"" which was very interesting since I went to the front desk and told the person working and they said ""I'll put in your service request."" I would completely understand the first time making the request and it slipping through the cracks. I could even understand two times. But, four times is completely ridiculous. We pay a lot of money for such a simple request. 

I made the request for the ice box the week after Thanksgiving. I made the second request last week. At some point this week I'll go make the third request and I'm sure I'll be told ""no one has requested any service for your apartment"" and I'm going to try my hardest not to laugh.

They send out emails only sometimes addressing the issue and act like it's not a big deal or a recurring issue. Some of the front desk people are rude, I've been literally yelled at about having a ""large"" box delivered? I was told I should go and pick it up instead of having it delivered because they can't accommodate it? it was a large-ish box that took up very little room. Unbelievable. Other front desk people are amazing and I feel awful that they have to deal with all the requests of people's AC units not working. They should not have to fix that, maintenance should but it's nonexistent. Also if you're impressed by the rooftop, please know you get kicked out at midnight like you are in summer camp.

The interior of the apartments are modern and upscale. No complaints at all. The employees (custodians, groundskeepers, leasing office) are all very nice and attentive. For the most part, service request are promptly attended to. 

The amenities at this complex are really top-notch. The leasing office often puts events on from inviting a brewery company to sample different beers or to making candy apples. A nice touch and a way to meet-and-greet with other neighbors. 

The lounges and cabanas look great, but some tenants (which is to be expected at a large complex) are disrespectful in regard to taking care of the furniture (cigarette burns/disgusting stains). 

We only had one issue, which was eventually fixed, but imo... it took too long after we complained multiple times(six months).

You know the NEMA neighborhood is a nightmare. Night of the living dead. So when a pet relieves itself in the garage so it's human doesn't have to dodge the discarded needles and human shit in the neighborhood maybe STFU when the renter, your boss essentially, allows the relief on occasion.

I just moved to Denver (2 days before writing this) from KC and I looked at probably 20 different apartments before choosing 2785 Speer.  I was super nervous about choosing this place because of all the negative reviews people had online but have had a great experience so far.

#1)  Far as I can tell every entrance is fob access and as good as you can expect security wise.  If you don't want your stuff stolen, don't store it in the one place people can get in and out of during access and if you do, lock it appropriately.  I think management has done a good job related to security. 

#2) if you want some real advice on an apartment building: snag a resident on a tour building and ask them straight up.  Nearly everyone will be honest. Take all reviews posted anywhere with a grain of salt (including this one). 

#3) Can't speak to any previous management staff but the current staff has been great to work with.  The only issues (if you call them that) I've had are just real world practical limitations of communication and responsiveness that you can expect with anything, and really not a big deal for someone that can practice very basic patience and understanding. 

Maintenance dude Shaun (Sean?) was probably one of the friendliest and most willing to help guys I've ever met (I've lived in a lot of apartment / loft buildings in several areas).

In making my move to San Jose, I shopped around quite a bit - I visited close to 10 different apartments and condos. At the end, the best won out - Century Tower. I love my pad here. 

Here are the pros (and I'll also share the cons after):
- State of the art GYM! Battle ropes, awesome treadmills, you name it, they have it. I love the fact that the gym is 24-hours. 
- Poolside BBQ grills (there are two). I've used them twice already. Had a blast. 
- Rooftop hang-out. There'a BBQ grill here too! But the real winner here is the spectacular view of San Jose. One is very hard-pressed to find such a panoramic view.
- Lobbies - there are two lobbies, and they are both posh as heck. I believe I once commented, ""Forget the units, I want to live here!""
- Events - the staff here really goes out of its way to make it a friendly mingle atmosphere. I especially want to give a shout-out to my homeboy Jose~
- Natural Lights galore! If you like natural light shining into your unit, then you'll love Century Tower. My windows faces westwards, so we get the best of all worlds. 
- Proximity to SJC (San Jose Airport). It makes air travel so convenient. There are free buses (#10) that take you to/from San Jose. The airport is literally 5 minutes away by drive. FYI, you can't hear any of the planes from this complex. It's most likely because we are parallel to the runaway (not perpendicular).

Here are the cons:
- The staff is still new, so they occasionally make mistakes here and there. BUT they are REALLY quick to follow-up and fix it as well. 
- Pets. I don't have one, but I hear it's not totally pet friendly here. 
- Seedy neighborhood. I usually drive around, so I never really need to walk around this neighborhood...but once I did, and boy...it's quite a bit creepy. Casinos being nearby probably has an affect.

In my first encounter, one of the attendants casually tossed that studios were $2,000 a month. Apparently this was misleading because, a week later, the woman working the desk told me otherwise: $1,795, and there were no recent price changes. So, the first guy was either extremely misinformed about his own prices, or somehow I didn't fit the right demographic (which I take as a compliment!).

Anywho, this is already pricey for the area, but the problem was the intellectually-dishonest attitude. The second attendant proceeded to emphasize how prices just keep going up. So what about wintertime? She said, if anything, that they RAISE their prices even more then. This is the most facetious lie I encountered that day (although, to be fair, I stopped watching the Trump administration's latest). I know the statistics of the apartment market, and know San Diego troughs collectively in the winter. So, either this property is enshrined with its own brand of economics-altering statistical powerstone...or the person was lying. I leave it to you to consider.

The second misdirection came soon afterwards. She proceeded to claim that they simply price in accordance to nearby buildings - and even listed them as equivalent places. But then I mentioned that one of the properties, which I also visited, is/was anywhere from $100-300 cheaper than them. Then she changed her tune and began to emphasize how different her complex was from that competitor. So wait, I thought you said they were equivalent? Make up your mind.

I recommend you simply look around with the housing engines, and/or wait for the low-season.

The staff were over the top pleasant, the building was well kept, and communication from the management team was stellar. Sure, there were issues with elevators, trash chutes, etc., As would be expected in a new building. At one point, each resident received a $100 gift card to Nordstrom's for the inconveniences. 
Now, 8 months later, the building has been under new management, Weidner, for about 3 or 4 months. We continue to have elevator issues, trash chute issues, water issues and basic building function issues. The new management and staff, whereas pleasant, do not communicate as well. Band aids have been repeatedly put on the ongoing issues in the building and there are no signs of things getting better . With elevators always down, you can count on long waits to get on/off your floor. Garbage builds up in the trash rooms, carpets not well maintained on the floors, temp regulation in common areas is lacking-too hot or too cold. Recently a water pipe burst, flooding the storage areas. Communication regarding that mishap was very slow and lacking. 
Tower 12 is in a great location. Easy access to most of Seattle. We pay premium rent for this convenience. We also pay top dollar for a residence to be functional and not be repeatedly put out by things that do not work. This is not the case . We have lived in other high rises without the issues we encounter here.  Bottom line, It's not worth the money to live here. It is not worth the frustration to live here.

Here is a break down of my thoughts in each attribute:

Building- Great efficiency for utilities! My electric bill hasn't been more than $55 and I've been here for 11 months! (granted it is just me, and I don't get cold easily) My apartment has an awesome view and I don't hear my neighbors. 

Maintenance- The guys (Tim & Ray) who run the requests around here are the best I've ever ran into. They have been super prompt and really cool. 

Parking- I have an assigned spot that I pay for but the office offers guest parking passes so my girl can stay without the hassle of parking at a meter. That is a huge deal for me and I'm grateful the management started offering it.

Neighbors- Everyone one I've met here in the building have been pretty nice. I've gone to few of the resident functions that Verve offers just to meet some people. Work makes it tough to go all the time but it's nice that some of the happy hours they have are in the building or near by.

Management - The office has been really easy to talk to and really seem to care about my requests. Huge perk is that the property is managed by Lincoln Property. That means a lot since my job has me traveling and could potentially relocate me.

Parking in a gated garage is an extra $100/month or so but I park on the street. I have always found a parking spot within a block. There are frequent car break-ins, though, so neighbors just make sure they remove valuables.

The complex has a really nice resident lounge with a full kitchen, big-screen television set, and pool table, and can be used for free any time if it's not reserved. Residents can reserve it for a reasonable fee. There is also a cozy movie theater with eight cushy seats (couch and armchairs) that also can be used for free or reserved for a fee for private events. The complex also has an outdoor lap pool, and there are two nice outdoor grills with covered, outdoor seating nearby. The landscaping is beautiful.

The staff are helpful and friendly. The whole complex is new, and the builders carried a bowling theme inside the complex which is fun. (The complex is built on the site of the defunct Leilani Lanes.)

The price is great for the location and I had initially planned on renewing for another year, but the past few months have been truly horrible. The main laundry room flooded on our block of the complex after the severe thunderstorms in the area several weeks ago. It has been boarded up and out of commission ever since, so I have been driving my laundry across the street to use a different facility in the meantime. Given the fact that the maintenance group is slow and truly careless I wouldnt count on it being operational any time in the near future. During the same string of thunderstorms, the ceiling in my bedroom started leaking. Although they did come out and address the problem on the roof itself, they have yet to repair the damage to the inside of my unit. More recently, we have been having issues with a leaky air conditioner. The maintenance has been out *literally* at least 3 seperate times to ""repair"" this problem, but as of today it is still leaking and the ceiling around the unit is starting to collapse. My first unit had SEVERE mold issues. There was some kind of leak in the side of the building, so every time it rained an entire wall of the bedroom would become completely saturated and the mold was completely out of control. Aside from the horrible maintenance, parking is extremely tight and the sidewalks are pretty poorly lit.

We filed a request with maintenance at the end of January which from our perspective appeared to be ignored for over three weeks.  We filed a follow up maintenance request, which was also ignored, but at least closed out quicker so we knew nothing was being done to help us.  We filed a third maintenance request and followed up by visiting the management office in person.  It was only then someone looked into the issue.  Turns out our downstairs neighbor was chain smoking and the smoke was filtering into our apartment via the laundry closet.  Although the apartment building was nice to identify the issue, there was nothing they could do about it other than fine the tenant below us.  It was not until the end of April 2018 before the smoking had stopped.  Meanwhile I had to find alternative living arrangements (since there were no offers of real solutions from the building to help and I have had too many relatives die of complications from cigarette smoke to think it was safe to live in that environment.  To note they did give me a $25 gift card to local restaurant for our inconvenience.)  My new living arrangements were well in the works before the smoking stopped. Once my plans were finalized, I went to end the lease early as was allowed in the lease, but the management company did not honor the lease end terms stated in the lease.  They said they wanted us to pay all of the incentives we received back as well.  We said fine and went to write them the check.  Our management office contact convinced us that they ""Never would allow an apartment to stay on the books for four months"" and that paying back the incentives was not the right thing to do and she was very sorry that was the request.  She suggested we take the ""give-them-the-keys-and-they-will-re-rent-it"" option because it would be cheaper and easier (which I have in writing in an email).  Needless to say that was not true and despite them having our keys since August 2018, they have not re-rented the apartment, but have posted the vacancy with a listing price of $378 more than our monthly lease payment (not leaving the impression they are really trying to re-rent the apartment).  And based on an email I just received from my lawyer, they still feel we should continue to pay them the remaining lease amount plus parking and internet for each month (18 mo. lease), which feels grossly unfair.

However, the gorgeous views soon took a back seat to my living experience at The Coast. The building is immaculate; the maintenance staff is not only prompt, courteous and friendly, but they go out of their way to keep the building exceptionally clean, and the tenants exceptionally happy.

This 'feeling' at The Coast extends to everyone who works there. Maureen is the best property manager I've ever dealt with. She's always anxious to help, and consistently goes 'above and beyond' to make you pleased. And while you'd probably expect this in a premium building like The Coast, she has this way of making you feel as though you're the most important person in the world, and in my experience, that's both special and unique.

This same sentiment also applies to the reception staff. Frank, Phil, Michael, Nita and others always greet you by your name, a helping hand, a kind word and a warm smile. Regardless of how busy they may be, they're always anxious to help in any way they can...even if it's just passing on a kind word to make the beginning - or end of your day - just a little brighter.

I've had the privilege of living in 'premium' residential buildings in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago and while all of them have been very good, The Coast has been - by a wide margin - the best. Due to a great career opportunity I had to leave Chicago and honestly, I was a little sentimental leaving Chicago...and my great experience at The Coast...behind.

As far as diners go, this place has all the classic & favorite options, all are done well, and everyone is friendly and respectful. Their cinnamon rolls are out of this world, you get a lot of tasty cinnamon goodness for your money! I've also seen a nice deal for seniors as a senior special.

Meanwhile, because of the origins of the owner, great Greek dish options await, and they sit on display in the dessert counter. Quite a lovely span of menu options as a result. And in the back? A classic, retro 60s - 70s diner lounge awaits. Classic!

This place is not supposed to be compared to your 5-star, 5-dollar-sign gourmet restaurant experiences. The Overlook is a classic diner with a classic lounge in the back and classic service. It is well priced and very well liked by all who frequent it.

I decided to upgrade to a convertible 1630/month. The only good thing about this unit was the high ceilings, although it was my mistake to rush into this upgrade I missed some things while touring the unit. Such as, the applianced (although stainless stee) were cheap quality, the door knobs did not match (some were gold some were silver) the bathroom and kitchen cabinetry had cracks, now these may sound like small things, but at 1600 a month, these are things that shouldn't be wrong with a unit. The building is always VERY well maintained and they decorate beautifully for Christmas, plus most of the staff is very nice and courteous.

Two Tree Management has leased out the lower floors to the Department of Education and they are currently building a school. Had I known that there would be such prolonged construction I never would have rented an apt here. Especially since I work from home and during daytime the construction noise is UNBEARABLE. After long negotiations Two Trees Management finally agreed to release us from the lease. So we are getting out of here at the end of the month. 2. The second problem a prospective renter should be aware of is that THE WALLS are paper thin! We can hear our neighbors' conversations almost as if they are in our unit, and that's on both sides. Listening to my neighbor's bathroom activities and knowing that they could hear us too is depressing. There is literally ZERO PRIVACY. Two Trees Management cut major corners when insulating the building. Now they are trying to market tenement quality soundproofing as ""Luxury Rentals"" experience.

Where Station House truly failed me was after my lease ended. The staff at Station House made a unilateral decision to replace the flooring in my unit in order to fix minor surface scratches in the floor. Scratches so small that they had to hold the camera inches above the floor to even document them. The charges they assigned to these unnecessary repairs just happened to equal the total of my security deposit. The lack of integrity of those involved is appalling.

Those who work at the concierge desk rarely verify/check the strangers who walk into the building to visit residents, deliver food, etc. There's a sign that states visitors must sign in, but the concierge desk doesn't ask people to do so.

Even if a doorman asks where a guest is going, there's absolutely no verification done (like in many NYC doorman buildings, where the doorman calls the resident). Honest question: What is the point of asking what unit someone is going to if you aren't going to verify that the resident is aware?

8/29/2017,42976,4.0,"I moved in mid-summer and am thrilled with my decision. 
1. The building is brand new, beautiful and impeccably maintained. It always smells (and looks) so fresh, so clean. Whoever designed the apartments and common areas knew how to create luxury.
2. Amenities are very nice. Gym is always empty so I'm never fighting for a machine. The upstairs lounge and rooftop are also a gem. If only there was a pool! 
3. It's very quiet. It's a dog friendly building but I've never heard an ounce of a bark or even just my neighbors in general. I believe there is padding underneath the floors as well to absorb sound from level to level - very smart. It's also quiet from outside noise. 
4. Amazing staff and management. The friendliest, most helpful and considerate team out there. They respond quickly and address any concerns/requests. No complaints.
5. No maintenance issues thus far. Everything works beautifully in my apartment and the appliances are all pretty nice for a rental building. 
6. Building events - management plans happy hours, etc. on the rooftop to gather residents together. It's really nice! 

The only two downsides I've experienced thus far -
1. Key fobs. You use this for everything versus a key. Normally would seem pretty cool and tech savvy, but they are required to go anywhere but the ground floor in the elevator. This is a huge pain in the butt for several reasons - 1) carrying bags or groceries from my car in the garage up to my apartment, my hands are full, but I need to swipe this to get into both the elevator bank and to my floor once I'm in the elevator; 2) on the rooftop with friends who inevitably need to take frequent bathroom breaks or just go to my apartment for whatever reason, so I either have to escort them down and back with my fob, or they have to take my keys and can never figure out the fob system themselves; 3) guests coming over - the front desk concierge has to escort them into the elevator to swipe them upstairs, which just seems ridiculous for the poor staff to have to do as often as guests come to our building 

I understand there are safety reasons for doing this in entrance banks or amenities but it seems a tad bit extreme and is just a nuisance when it comes to the elevators.

2. Fire Alarms. They've probably gone off 5 times since I've moved in about 6 weeks ago, not counting times I have not been home I heard they went off (after confirming with neighbors). This is a big pain point and something many residents have complained about just in neighbor chatter. I wish management would be more transparent with the residents as to what is going on - are there repeat resident offenders that need a stern warning, are they false alarms, etc. It seems each time the fire trucks come it's a false alarm - so is the system overly sensitive or just not working? The reason management should communicate to us about this is because with time it's pretty clear not everybody even evacuates anymore. When the alarms went off at 1am last night (yes 1am, in a deep sleep) and I eventually left my apartment, I saw plenty of my neighbors in their pajamas in the hallways laughing and debating whether or not to evacuate. And I honestly don't blame them - but my better judgement forced me to leave. I have lived in numerous rental and condo buildings over the past 12 years and never experienced frequency like this before.

All in all - lovely place to live and somewhere I'd recommend but would love to get more feedback on what's causing the fire alarm issues!",1.0,Gold,62.0,4.0,1.0

9/19/2018,43362,1.0,"My husband left a very broad review but for as much as strife as this place has caused me, I will choose to elaborate. I recently moved out of 13th & Market after being a tenant there for three years. 

I'd like to start with the 1st year of living here. We lived on the 1st floor apt which leads directly to the street. So for a tiny studio at a mere $1800 you are awarded a homeless person sleeping on your porch and/or knocking on your door all hours of the day/night. Can't even have your blinds up b/c if they see you, they'll come a knocking. In October of 2015, after approx. one month of living here I started getting large red welts on my arms, neck, & face. Almost looked like mosquito bites. My husband did not have them. After reporting the issue to the property manager at the time, Angela, (there were several property managers in a 1 month period at this time), they sent out their preferred exterminator. He did not find anything upon his investigation but suggested that my brand new/one month old mattress had been delivered with spiders inside of it. Crazy right? So we don't buy that explanation. We purchase a mattress cover but nothing changes. I spend thousands of dollars to go to several dermatologists/get tests b/c we are starting to believe something is really wrong with me. Every doc immediately says bed bugs but b/c their exterminator insisted it was not, the problem was not resolved. I could not even wear a short sleeve shirt in public. I was mortified. 6 MONTHS GOES BY! In April, I get home from work & feel something crawling on me, low & behold, my brand new bed frame was infested with BED BUGS!! Every piece of furniture we owned was brand new, as we did not want to travel cross country with furniture. So I don't know if they were living dormant in the carpet or what but I now have permanent scars all over my arms to prove it. Thanks for the memories, 13th and Market. So when it was discovered that they were indeed bed bugs, my husband, myself, and our dog had to sleep on the couch for an entire month while they fumigated our bedroom. So not only did we have to purchase all new bedroom furniture, we had to pay $400 for the treatment done by the same IDIOT exterminator who said I had spiders living in my mattress. No wonder others have reported cockroaches because this is their preferred vendor. By the time I discovered they were bed bugs, we had been through several property managers & they had no idea of the situation at all/ were not helpful or sympathetic in any way shape or form. Actually. An employee did suggest I buy scar cream from Sprouts. How helpful. The scars are awful and can be seen in all of my wedding photos even. 

Besides the fact I am scarred for life, no pun intended, all this place cares about is how much money they can get out of you. Don't be enticed by the LOW deposit like we were. You'll be slapped with hundreds of dollars in repairs upon move out. They don't do a walk through with you upon move in or move out. So they'll basically just make up whatever they want. It's a bunch of he said/she said bullsh*t. First year, parking was free for one vehicle. Second year, $15 for parking. Third year, we buy another vehicle, and suddenly parking sky rockets to $150?! One car - $15, two cars - $150. What is the logic in that?!

A few other notes. The elevators take forever. The pool was closed for half of our last summer there due to leaks. Security is essentially non existent. Cars have been broken into. My husband's bicycle was stolen. The communication is horrid. The front office people are not warm, welcoming or friendly WHATSOEVER. Finally, they got rid of Barbara. She was on of the rudest people I've ever come across. Made multiple complaints about her. No one ever gave a damn. Matter of fact, the tenants in this building are also some of the rudest, pretentious people. With that being said, another situation I would like to mention, a couple who lived on the same floor as us had two very small dogs that would constantly bark and try to go after my 50 pound pit bull. I know this sounds ridiculous but she is very timid so she was frightened by them & their constant yapping. So her natural reaction is to growl back at them in defense. This couple complained to the office though our dog had nothing wrong. The property manager, Peter, suggested our dog wear a muzzle while she was on the property. A MUZZLE! UM NO.She's 8 years old. Has lived in several apartment communities & has never had an experience such as this. Prime example of breed discrimination in this building though they tried to act as if this was not the issue. 

OH! I also once found an open package of syringes in the parcel pending locker. And the walls are so paper thin, I could constantly hear our neighbor having sex. I even had to leave a note on his door.

4/9/2008,39547,4.0,"If you want to live in a brand-new apartment building with granite countertops, more bathrooms than bedrooms, and a parking lot outside your front door, this is NOT the place for you. But if you love having plants growing outside your door, being able to let your kids or dogs run around outside, a fast commute to downtown, and a life that doesn't require getting in a car--it's hard to think of a better place to rent. Yes, the kitchens are tiny--I think the kitchens are the same size in the 3 bedroom townhouses as in the 1 bedroom apartments. The dishwasher is so small we've never bothered to use it. The kitchen appliances are basic (nothing fancy), but quite functional. However, we have our own washer and dryer in our basement--some units do have them. As for building age and maintenance: Our apartment was renovated just before we moved in, the windows are all in good shape, etc. We have wood floors throughout--parquet on the first floor--no worries about spills or stains. The buildings are 1930s construction, with all the accompanying assets and flaws. The ceilings are slightly higher than in newer places. The units appear to have been built well originally, but the renovations since then have been done on the cheap. The walls are real plaster, not drywall, but there's no insulation in the outside walls, and so our heating bill was high in cold months. The sound insulation between units is not bad--we can only hear our neighbors from the basements and when they use the stairs. All of our maintenance requests have been answered VERY promptly. We asked to read the lead testing results on the property before we signed the lease--there is no lead paint on building interiors, only on the exteriors of the white buildings, which were repainted after those results were found. In contrast to other online reviews, we have not had any problems with our payments not being credited to our account, or with any additional fees. However, we do NOT pay rent online (because we read those reviews, and heard about the problems with the online payments).

They are now blatantly violating lease terms and breaking the law. I'm consulting with legal counsel for a lawsuit. Possibly a class action. They are forcing people to hire maid services for cleaning upon moving out and threatening withholding security deposit if you don't. This is not in the lease and a clear violation. I have countless documented problems with their management, service, and maintenance not living up to their end of the lease. They have a roach problem that has spread throughout the property. Though Building 1 is updated, the other 2 are not and haven't been in a generation. They are lower rent than updated building 1 and in poor condition which is attracting unsavory residents. There is a crime problem and security is very poor. A lot of break-ins and thefts. Their business center is a joke. Computers are always broke or have viruses. They do nothing to maintain the computers or keep the business center clean and professional. They hire very cheap contractors for everything that do not care and are rude and incompetent. Everything from maintenance to life guards at the pool. If you move in, make sure you are there when maintenance is there for anything. They either won't fix it right the 1st time or break something else. Or like in some of my situations, complete disregard for personal belongings.

4/5/2017,42830,5.0,"I moved to Cambridge in early 2016 and found this building and it was perfect. I lived here for just over a year and loved every minute of it. 

First off the design of the unit was just perfect. Perfect layout with floor to ceiling windows and stainless steel appliances. I had a parking spot inside the garage to store the car but to be honest I hardly drove during the time I was here. The Alewife redline train station is a short less than 5 minute walk away along the Alewife reservation trail. I loved the fact that I could walk to the train in only a few minutes and I didn't even need to walk along the street. Loved loved loved that! 

Overall the things I loved about this building was it's location, you're right on the Alewife reservation so you can go for a stroll or a bike ride along the trail by just going through the back exit. I loved the networking room that had conference rooms and areas I could use to work from home. I loved the proximity to public transportation, the fact that I was within a 10 minute walk/2 minute drive to Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Panera Bread, Bertuccis and a host of other places. I loved that there was a pool that wasn't on the ground floor, I could swim and enjoy the view of the Alewife reservation at the same time. I also loved the gym with floor to ceiling windows.

But above all else, I loved the sense of community here. I got to know all the maintenance folks and they responded to all my queries and requests within hours. on top of that almost every week there were one or more events. I met so many cool people that lived in the building and everyone was so open and friendly. The outdoor community barbeques and the painting+wine nights win the events category for me.

A few more things that were special to me was the fact that there is a unit that could be rented short-term for when visitors came to visit me. I've usually had to get a 2-bed apartment just in case visitors came but in this case I could get a 1-bed and reserve the guest apartment for my visitors. I really liked that. Valet trash was great! I loved the fact that I could leave my trash right outside my door for pick up.

The bottom line: my apartment itself is pretty nice, I got lucky and have good immediate neighbors, and I love the building's shared amenities and proximity to the park. Maintenance and service generally is not always the best, but you get what you pay for, and by that measure the Woodner is a good value. Apartment quality - I do not have one of the newly renovated apartments, so my kitchen and bathroom are a little shabby, but I love the size of the apartment (it feels pretty spacious for a studio) and my view over Rock Creek Park. I'm on a high floor, so the light is good, and I have not had pest issues - although I think this depends greatly on the apartment. All utilities are included, and the heat and AC are very powerful (and free!) so that's nice. Location - Love that it is close to Rock Creek Park for runs, and the 16th St bus lines. It's a bit of a walk to the Giant/Target, but doable. Safety and community - As a single woman, I have never felt unsafe here, although I did have several packages taken from outside my door (most package delivery is done to one of two offices, but Amazon next-day shipping likes to leave it at your door for some reason). The building is certainly home to some... characters, but aside from a few unpleasant interactions, this hasn't been an issue for me. I guess I got lucky in my immediate neighbors. Noise has also not been an issue for me, but I don't know if that's due to the cinderblock walls or good neighbors. Public spaces and amenities - The Woodner is an older building, so nothing is shiny and perfect, but the amenities are pretty nice. I have made good use of the pool (which is surprisingly often uncrowded) and the fitness center (which just got some new machines), and I appreciate the convenience of the ground-floor mini-supermarket, dry cleaning, and laundry room. Service - The leasing office is fairly incompetent. It took a whole month of back-and-forth and the signing and correcting of various forms before we could finalize a lease transfer from my friend to me. However, the good news is that once your lease is final you really don't have to deal with them. Resident services and maintenance are pretty mixed - sometimes problems were fixed right away, sometimes it took multiple phone calls to resolve major issues like a leak and falling plaster in my bathroom ceiling. And as it's an older building, things do break pretty regularly. They have also entered my apartment without warning or permission, and moved a bunch of my stuff in order to deal with some problem in a neighboring apartment, so that was pretty annoying.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

2/19/2018,43150,1.0,"This is the main reason for my review. We had 2 non-working elevators for almost 5 months and also we had a neighbor smoking in his apartment for 2 months, and there was little visible action from the management, and not only that we were sleeping with the smell of the smoke and waking up from 2 am to 5 am because we were unable to sleep because of the horrible smell and not only that, all of our clothing in the closet had the smell of cigarettes. Also, having the fire alarm going off over 19 times at all time of the day, forcing you to go down 6 floors to find out it was just a false alarm, and to see older individuals going down the stairs as well and families with their newborns, even on weekends, and not seeing an apology from the management, was something we were so over it. A major issue was the fact that we had three management companies in less than six months. 

Also, besides of not having hot water multiple times for multiple days during winter time and the management makes you go to a gym away from the apartment complex to take a shower, I must say the amenities in this place are good. The most significant issue with this building is the manager. She is always too busy to talk to you in the office. Most of the time that other residents or myself go to the office and her leasing consultant's agents must say she is not available because she is with somebody else or on the phone with someone. The issue is that her office has a huge glass window that happens to be on the walkway when I walk my dog, and I have seen her doing nothing nor with someone and not on the phone. The times you go to speak to her and have the chance to do it, she talks to you like she is superior, she even changes her tone of voice and facial expressions and shows negative energy. 

The biggest issue that happens to me was during our renewal process; this management was so disorganized on how to proceed with my renewal letter. I was under an affordable housing program, and every time they requested a document, and I send it to them they took so long to reply to either inform their received it or to let me know everything was good. We had to email her every time to find out we were missing some paperwork. This was our biggest nightmare with them, the way they handle all the renewal process took most of our energy. We were in a constant struggle to stay positive because of the lack of communication from the manager. We exchange over 100 emails to try to have our issue resolve, which was income qualification. This was by far one of the worst experience I ever experience with a management company, and I blame the manager the most for her lack of organization.  

An issue I had is the fact that the maintenance team takes their sweet time to complete work orders and you must email management multiple times to see some action.  Not only that, but the management also take their time to respond and of course do not offer an apology for the inconvenient. 

 We were great residents that always kept an eye in the building to make sure residents were taking care of common areas; we were always very diligent when we saw things out of place or when people were damaging the property. We are very proud of being great residents. We always took care of our apartment since that was our home and we did make sure our home was clean and in a perfect condition, which the management were a witness when they inspected the apartment and did not have anything damage nor dirty. Indeed, we loved to live at Latitude since it is in a great location with good amenities, but sometimes that is not enough to provide an excellent score.

Also, we have TWO HIGHLY SECURE GARAGE parking spots, and, as mentioned often below, the water bill is wrapped in with the rent bill.

The gym is well stocked and open 24 hours and almost no one is there. The pool is popular with families and others. The design throughout is very nice but some of the construction (windows, floors, walls) is not top-notch. Nevertheless, David, the Head of Maintenance, with his team, fix things really fast. South Weymouth is not Newton, but Derby Street, not very far from this place, is more like Newton and Brookline. This entire greater project is called Union Point is it going to be a really cool 'City of the Future'!! It is being constructed all around us here. 
Do a google-search of UNION POINT, click on ** images **and see the future....

NOT PROVIDED,NOT PROVIDED,4.0,"[u""\r\n                                Background: I choose TROY Boston after touring numerous luxury apartments in the Boston, including: Inkblock (no rooftop deck), AVA Theater District (too expensive), AVA North Point (neighborhood is too quiet), and the Kensington (no rooftop deck). I choose TROY Boston because it was one of the cheapest and because it had all the amenities I wanted from a luxury building.\n\nThe Building: The amenities for the building are on par if not better than other apartment complexes in the greater Boston area. The building has two roof top decks (one of which aren't open as of July 2015); the rooftop deck on the mid-rise tower has views of South End, Back Bay, Southie, and has two outdoor grills and a kitchen, which is great of entertaining. Also, there is a small swimming pool area, a dog walking area, a community lounge with a pool table, and a small gym, which contains some treadmills, multi-function cable fly machine, and dumbells, which goes up to 60 pounds. \n\nThe units: I would describe the units as industrial modern chic. My studio unit has hardwood floors, exposed concrete ceiling, in-unit washer and dryer, and modern finishes in the the bathroom and kitchen. The only draw back is the refrigerator, which seems smaller compared to normal refrigerator. Also, there is nearly floor to ceiling windows, so units get great light.\n\nThe location: This is the only major draw back for the building, as the building is located in a somewhat desolate area and foot traffic dies down significantly after rush hour. I wouldn't describe the area as unsafe, but I would be aware of my surroundings at night. A homeless shelter is located across the street and a housing project is only a block away. Ironically, even though the immediate area is up and coming, the building is only a few blocks away from great bars and restaurants in the South End and Southie. \n\nPublic Transportation: The Orange Line (Tufts Medical Center) is about a 10 min walk, the Red Line (Broadway) is also about a 10 min walk, while the Green Line (Arlington or Chinatown) is about a 15 min walk. The 9 and 11 bus stops a block away and goes to the Back Bay and Downtown Crossing.\r\n                            ""]",1.0,Gold,62.0,4.0,1.0

A quick background: we moved in Summer of 2009 to a 1-bedroom apartment from East Lakeview. We both work in the north suburbs and do not own a car. Over our 4 years here, the building has undergone numerous management changes and we've interacted with everyone mentioned in previous reviews but I have to say that we've had an overall fantastic experience living here. The number one benefit to us is the proximity to the Howard El stop. This stop is where the purple, yellow, and red lines meet. Getting to work my wife and I take the yellow and purple lines, respectively and not once have we encountered a time where we felt unsafe. Going out for drinks after work on Friday's is a breeze as we can catch the purple line express and be in Lakeview/Wrigleyville in 15 minutes. The apartment itself has a great deal of room and the layout is pretty nice. We have in unit washer/dryer. A washing machine, central air, and a decent sized balcony. None of these things did we have in our apartment in Lakeview. I won't get into the people that used to work here because, well they don't work here now so who cares? The people that currently work here are some of the nicest people I've dealt with in terms of apartment management/maintenance. csb One day our dishwasher started making weird noises. It wasn't broken and still cleaned dishes, but it was a bothersome sound. We just mentioned it in passing to maintenance not really expecting anything and ___ immediately offered to replace it. Next day, our dishwasher was replaced. /csb Another recent addition in the past year has been the plethora of building events that ___ puts on in the resident lounge. At least once but sometimes two-three times per month there is a resident activity. Whether it's bingo, karaoke, hair/nailes/massage, holiday parties, it is always fun and you can get to meet some of your neighbors. Most importantly though, there is a lot of booze provided. Now the negatives, as mentioned the surrounding neighborhood isn't that great but again not once in our 4 years have myself or my wife have felt threatened and we are the kind of people that come in pretty late on the weekends and leave for work before sunrise during the week. That's about it, if I could give this review a 4.5 I would and that -.5 would be for the neighborhood. Don't move here if you're looking for a place with a lot of local nightlife.

9/21/2018,43364,5.0,"This is the best luxury apartment building in Chicago. I have lived in several here over the past few years, and never felt more at-home & happy than at WPW. The units are perfect - excellent appliances and furnishing. The location is literally the best possible for downtown. It feels like you're on an island away from all the traffic, and the riverwalk is just a short block away. Views are unparalleled.

Our unit faces southwest, which is great since there is some new construction to the east. We don't hear any noise from it. The amenities are truly unrivaled, with a rooftop gym (including private sauna & steam room) and lounge. 

This building is also VERY dog-friendly - indoor and outdoor spaces for dogs, a great dog-walking service (Wolf Point Walkers), and a social community of dog owners who meet up regularly. 

The building is full of vibrant life & residents, which means amenities like the pool can be crowded. But everyone is very friendly. The workers are especially great - especially the front desk team & Carlton in the leasing group. 

The only few cons I can think of:
- Taxis for the hotel across the cul-de-sac often drive into the area at dangerous high speeds, they really need to cool their jets.
- The construction means that one of the sidewalks exiting the cul-de-sac is closed for months, which is an inconvenience when walking to work. But with few cars, walking on the street is barely ever an issue. 
- Porch spiders! This is a problem anywhere in Chicago, but yikes, those are some big spiders. The window cleaners do clear them off each season, but you'll need to do your own clearing often too.

After reviewing these reviews, I agree with Kelly K.'s post the most. Been here for almost a year now. It was the perfect location, amenities, etc. when I moved it. Still is, however the cleanliness of the apartment complex itself is troublesome. 

I find myself gagging every time I have to walk into the garbage area because it's either packed with recycle and old trash bags because the garbage is filled up. Or when it's not packed with recycling and garbage you can see the stains all over the floor from spilled liquids or God knows what. Also, the fact that there has been two pee stains (from what I assume is dog pee) in the back entrance stairwell for months now is pretty gross and unsettling (still has yet to be picked up). I called about this, but nothing was done. It shouldn't be the tenants responsibility to notify the staff of this issue. For months there was blood stains on the door that leads to the back of the apartment and just recently got cleaned. 

Security is another complaint I have. There have been multiple break-ins since living here for the past year. Bikes have been stolen, cars have been broken into. I per de have not be victim to this, however, I ensure you that I wouldn't feel comfortable with my car in the parking garage.

First and foremost, the camaraderie in the community and neighborhood is wonderful. Across the street, we have access and connections to city and suburbs through public transportation. We have an excellent mall right across the street (and other malls throughout the surrounding suburbs) with convenient shops, grocers, drug stores, and restaurants. I receive e-mails from the mayor with community events all year round. The nearby suburbs accommodate all our needs. When I arrived in this amazing and beautiful d?cor, the apartments, lobby and hallways were newly renovated. The surrounding view of the lake from the balcony is breathtaking. The lounge decor and atmosphere are relaxing with friends or alone. I can just sit back with a cup of Starbucks coffee. As I enjoy the aroma, I can sit back and enjoy either of the two flat screen TV's there. I have scheduled parties in the lounge and it was a blast. If I don't have enough room in my apartment, I can request accommodating suites in the building for my out-of-town guests and reserve parking during their stay here in the building.

The Metropolitan was hands down the best place I've ever lived. They made living there so easy. The package system was amazing: you never have to worry about a package being stolen. The club house was always well maintained, and the patios and pool were always appealing. I thoroughly enjoyed the gym, which rivaled the gym at my workplace and any boutique gym experience you have. They have trash chutes that are readily available, except for where I lived on the first floor: so I had to go up to one of the higher floors to take out trash. That was occasionally annoying. My experience wasn't perfect, but it was ridiculously close. Maintenance and porters are great: they stayed on top of keeping the building in good shape. Some residents are nasty (e.g., letting their dogs poop and pee by doors and elevators and not picking it up; putting their trash on the floor next to the chute instead of in the chute, dragging trash bags down carpeted hallways and letting their garbage juice leak on the carpet). But the porters are basically on staff 7 days a week. I really felt for them, having to clean up after lazy af residents. But these messes never stayed around long. The leasing office staff, assistant manager Anthony: professional, and good at what they do. They never made me feel stupid for having an issue or concern and always took my concerns seriously. They are generally very transparent on all their policies. Loved loved loved the smoke free building policy and that it was ENFORCED! My biggest issues were with the parking garage: people driving too fast, and not being able to find a space sometimes. I resolved the latter by just parking on upper levels, but the Speed Racers remained. The area around the building is very walkable. I was able to walk to Whole Foods, the dry cleaner, the bank, Merriweather Post Pavilion, the library, and of course the mall, all while living there for two years: 12 minutes to Whole Foods on foot! And there are plenty of trails for running and cycling nearby. I had easy access to 29 and 32. And the bus depot is at the mall (commuter and local). I never had to use them, but I saw some residents using them and I imagine that is convenient. It was also a very pet friendly building. I never had to worry about digging out after a snow: the maintenance staff were on top of it! I've been gone for 23 days and I miss it...a lot. Honestly, it's not literally metropolitan, especially compared to where I live now, but it's as close as you're going to get in Columbia. The rent is high, but I'd recommend being on the look out for deals, because they do come around.

Expected when living in a city on the border of Chinatown, but expected better dampening with the windows. Not to mention other residents on my floor. This was rough. Lots of students and they dont have much respect for noise levels.

The ultimate downfall to my experience with Ava Theatre is the parking lot in the back. If you own a dog you will encounter it. I have no idea why but the police and parking attendents just look the other way. Wasnt strange to see needles and crack pipes, prostitution and even sex acts between the cars. Just be smart and avoid it, otherwise dog owners kind of have to muddle through it to get the Commons.

However, the staff can be snooty and rude sometimes, except Kevin, he really helped me through the entire leasing process. Some of the concierge is cool too, especially Bryan (I think), he really goes above and beyond, but some rarely even speak. The major issue I have with the Fenwick is the noise level. Even though in our lease, it specifically tells us that ""quiet hours"" are between 11p-7a, it seems that some residents do not abide by this, and management does nothing to correct the issue even though I have complained about it several times. I don't know if my neighbor(s) are just obnoxiously loud or if its poor building structure, but either way, its extremely annoying if you have a job to attend in the morning.

While the buildings are old, I have experienced little to no structural/appliance issues. My microwave did fail but it was immediately replaced. My fear upon moving in was bugs, if only because I figured they may be present given Riverside s age and number of residents. I have had absolutely no such issue. The very minor complaint that I harbor is that maintenance, while quick, failed to be detail-orientated; in the sense that they left a bit of a mess each of the times they have visited. Otherwise, the entire experience has been pleasant. My rent is reasonable. I have not experienced any fluctuation in utility costs that I have read in other reviews. I have found other occupants of my tower to be super pleasant. The pool was clean when I visited in the summer. And the shuttle service to the Metro station is wonderfully convenient. Parking is always available, and same with laundry equipment. I can honestly say that because of some reviews, I was worried with my choice to live here. But during the course of my stay, I have not encountered the situations described by others. Perhaps I m lucky. I would certainly recommend Riverside to the value-conscious renter.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

Probably as all the others that have moved, I was charged a total of almost $2k in overcharges and fees for normal wear while I paid $2800 a month. RIDICULOUS! Thus, I will warn you that based on my experience I do NOT RECOMMEND this place nor classify it as a luxury rental. We had hardly any enjoyable access to the amenities because the pool is way too small for the amount of people, the sauna, steam room and gym software equipment hardly ever worked... constantly unavailable. Pool requires a wrist band to use it and only got 2 for a 2/2 apartment. Theres hardly ever a concierge avail for receiving deliveries or visitors. No security reliable measures whatsoever exist. SECURITY IS A JOKE!! Cops were parked in front of lobby resolving some sort of issue almost every month... wonder why... Apartments even caught up on FIRE! for lack of maintenance I heard from the affected residents. Balconies were not up to code when i moved so they had to place metal columns under each balcony interrupting our stay multiple times... scary!!. Some staff members are rude and never respond to emails. They are only nice when trying to get people to rent and after that, forget it! the visitors parking website ""conveniently"" stops working just so that cars get booted or mistakenly booted. It happened to my visitors twice.  Second Parking is avail at extra cost of $75/mo. Pets pay extra $20 each per month and $450 non refundable fee for each... and on top they still have the courage to over charge me at the end. I wish I could post pics i took before i left... no damages to property were left behind. Hallways smell like weed all the time,... if u care... Lowest quality of constuction inside the apartments. who the hell uses inflatable MDF material for baseboards?!! unless u never mop... and worst chinese quality quartz countertops... easy to stain and crack. The game room closes at 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays... really! Lost multiple delivery packages including my monthly delivery of medicines.

I concur with the other reviews except I don´t have a roach problem -- this time! Their construction projects are poorly thought out. I have to use a 25 foot extension cord to plug in my TV since they covered the previous outlet to put in a heating/cooling system. The old vents are still there--being a big hole in the floor. Maintenance is poor. I have water marks in the ceiling from leaks last winter, several different shades of paint from where they put the kitchen cabinets in; rust marks where they replaced the tolet and the bathroom light flashes even though they´ve been here 5 times. For each of improvements they send many letters announcing the change only to suprise you and have them bust in on you at another time. They leave a mess that takes hours to clean.

At our last apartment, the landlord was two-faced - said one thing, then price gouged us afterwards. I did NOT want to move into an apartment again after that experience, but we had to in order to sell & buy again. The Commons, particularly the management staff, surpassed all my expectations. They were friendly, remembered our names, always did what they said, and were really fair and reasonable. I really liked that they are active and involved with their tenants (though you definitely don't have to be). But it was nice to get to know them and I'm so glad we're neighbors. About the actual living space, everything was very well kept and maintained. Beautiful facility, and they were always responsive to any issues, which weren't much. We could hear a little above us and a little below us (we were on the 2nd floor), but never on the sides of us - and all our neighbors had dogs. These dogs were well behaved. We are cat people, but I like seeing people out and about with their dogs, so I don't have a problem with that. It was annoying that the dogs would pee on the grass by the door but... what do you expect? Also, while our water bills were more than the previous town we lived in, they were still relatively reasonable - never more than $55/mth. That's two people showering everyday, laundry 2-3x per week, and using a water filter for all our water. There seems to be some kind of a discrepancy though about the water billing.

They said they sent us multiple emails and notified us we should give notice before two months of our lease end date. We did not receive ANY.

We checked with their leasing team and two people confirmed that if we move out early, our apartment will be available for other people. If someone start the lease before May, we dont need to pay for the extra rent.

I then decided to move out one month eariler. At the date of my moving out, I confirmed with the leasing office again.

In 4 months I've had 4 garage remotes replaced, it took 2 months to get a new stove, because the one that came with apartment had roches living in it. I think when I mentioned I was thinking of calling corporate and the health department and send them photosand video showing them crawling around. I had to do a deep clean after I moved in because it had so much grease and dirt on top of cabinets, doir and window frames, in the utlity closet and on top of stakable dryers, air vent and lets not even talk about the microwave and dish washer. Then to have an pest control come they only sprayed around the stove, refrigerator and where the stackable w/d is. I wasnt crazy about the spray because it was not pet friendly. I have a dog. We had to leave for several hours. So hthat neither of us would not get sick. Whats with the club house beginning closed when the office closes. Its open during office hours when we are all at work.

The building is wonderful, clean and modern but what stands out is the staff. The concierge April is simply delightful.

April takes the class and professionalism of the building to a new level. She is the standard that I measure everyone to. 

I will rave about the building, April and the amenities but I can only give Viktoria two stars because of rude, unprofessional and crass behavior from other concierge staff. David, chef concierge, has been blatantly rude to me, my guests and even my dog walkers. His attitude suggests that myself and the other residents are nuisances to him yet he is in a position where he is asked to be courteous and helpful. This is why I can only give 2 stars.

8/23/2018,43335,5.0,"It feels a little early to write this, but I'll go for it. I moved here 1+ month ago from Excelsior. It is definitely an improvement and was worth the effort of moving. I highly recommend living here.

Our unit in Excelsior was unique and not representative of most units in that building, but with the concessions that AMLI offered, we are essentially paying the same amount in our first year for a 2 bed/2 bath at The Arc (with concessions) as we would for our 1 bedroom/1bath at Excelsior (post-concessions). 

We toured  the similar buildings - Kinects, Stratus, etc. Something about the details of the Arc felt right. The design is a bit over the top and flashy compared to the other buildings, but the actual construction quality, amenities/shared spaces, and the appliances feel nicer at The Arc. I like that the bedrooms don't have carpet. From experience, I know that carpet gets disgusting, and it is annoying to clean. I like that the stove is gas. The central air is controlled via Nest. The dishwasher is quiet. The fridge has the feature where you can get filtered water and ice from the outside. The water in the kitchen and bathrooms gets as hot as you need it and relatively quickly. The trash shoot was having issues for a minute, but they identified and resolved the issue very quickly, and there haven't been any more problems. 

I was nervous about sound from the surrounding construction, but the windows do a good job and block out most of the noise. I haven't felt disturbed by construction noise since moving here, and it is happening all of the time at all hours. 

I'll let others speak more to the amenities. I will say that I enjoy and use the space on the top floor. Sometimes there are big groups up there, and they can get a bit ratchet (in a ""I'm in my mid-20s and love having disposable income now!"" kind of way), but it's tolerable. Great views. And the outside area is amazing when weather permits it. 

I like that the coffee machine seems to be working 98% of the time, which was an issue for a while at Excelsior until they replaced it with a machine that yielded lower quality coffee. 

The Stratus location seemed like it could be better than The Arc. But I really like that Cap Hill is such as easy walk from The Arc. If I lived at Stratus, I don't think I'd be as likely to venture back to my old Cap Hill hood. The Arc location allows you to easily access the best of all neighborhoods.

I like that there is diversity in the building. I wouldn't say that it is economically diverse (I mean, given the rent cost) and a lot of people here work for Amazon, but coming from SF, it feels more like home. I struggled living in Seattle for my first year, because I felt like I was completely surrounded with passive, white people who couldn't directly communicate if they had an issue or needed something from someone else. It drove me completely insane during the winter months. I'm hopeful that this is a place that provides insulation from the freeze, and I will be able to meet new people.

I am an incredibly difficult person to read, especially if it is a situation where someone is trying to sell me something. Ken and Allan were great and did a good job responding to our needs/questions throughout the consideration/lease-signing process. They made me feel comfortable making such a significant decision, they didn't BS anything in order to get the deal, and they weren't shook by my severe case of RBF. 

The Lead Concierge, Chanelle, has proven to be especially amazing. I had some challenges with a package, and she went above and beyond to help me. I didn't like the concierge vibe that I was getting in one of the other buildings at all (I'll be nice and not call them out). But so far, the concierge service at The Arc has been fantastic. I'm really hoping that it stays this way after the building is fully leased up. 

Overall, I'm very happy with living here so far. I'm a little nervous about if the current level of service and number of building events will be maintained after the building is leased up. If it changes, you better believe this 5 star review is going away. But so far everything has been amazing, and I highly recommend living here.",1.0,Gold,66.0,5.0,1.0

3/11/2018,43170,3.0,"There are a few really great things about this building. The location is great, the apartments are new and have modern appliances, and there are a lot of options for ameneties. However, there are quite a few caveats and issues, some that can be attributed to growing pains, but many to mismanagement. First, since the amenities opened 8 months ago, residents have had to fight and lobby for real operating hours. The hours started with the deck, pool and other common areas open from 7 am to 8 Pm. You can imagine the outrage many of us felt, which prompted them to increase the hours to 7-10, then months later from 7-11, with later hours on the weekend. Now, one of the huge selling points for this building is the pool and hot tub, however incoming residents should know the pool closes at 9:30 on weeknights, and 8PM on weekends, making it virtually impossible to entertain in. Add that to the fact they keep the hot tub at 96 degrees, which is like sitting in a lukewarm tub. I know this sounds trivial, but it's not when you pay a premium and expect things to be open and work correctly. The other issue is the amenities are managed by a third party company called Iowa Sports, which was never disclosed to incoming residents. So, what happens, is they both pass blame to the other when you have an issue you need addressed. That, and it takes several emails and follow ups to get an answer they clearly don't want to give. All I'm saying is, ask detailed questions about the ameneties, because not all is what it seems. On to the major issue with the building; the elevators. I've personally been stuck 4 times in an elevator here, once for over an hour. When you're not getting stuck, at least 1 or 2 elevators are not working. The building blames this on the wind, which I must admit is a new one. I live on a high floor, so this is extremely inconvenient, especially when carrying groceries. I like many of the people here, but it's clear the building was rushed to get open, and they still don't quite have it figured out. All I'm saying, is ask questions.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

Moving from Miami and knowing I wasn't going to have a car, I was nervous about moving to Maryland at first. The location of the Citron was the perfect transition spot to a new area. All the shops are walking distance and couldn't be any more convenient. Having whole-foods right across the street made grocery shopping a breeze. My walk to the metro station is about 10 mins so my commute to work is better than I first anticipated. 

The staff at the citron is so personable and helpful. They're always sure to take care of any of your needs and get back to you at a timely manner. I have to say, I'm really going to miss Jeffery, as he has been the best concierge I've ever had. 

The apartment itself is clean, fresh, and new. Never had an issue with any appliances or electrical/pluming issues. Our apartment faces the courtyard and gets plenty of sunlight. Surprisingly you hear very little, to no street noise in the courtyard. I was a bit worried I would be able to hear all the music coming from downtown, but once inside I was pleasantly surprised.

The amenities in the building are great. Gym is a little small, but has all the necessities. Pool is small but relaxing, but my favorite is the entertaining/grill area. Great for guests and bbqs. And if you don't have cable or wifi, head down to the lobby and lounge by the tvs. They offer free wifi and coffee. 


Overall I would give the building the 5 of 5.

The location is quite, close to the park and bike trails, but also close enough to shops and food. The building is clean, welcoming, and has a nice modern feel.

Poor business practices have led to a seemingly never ending mountain of problems, largest of which is the complete lack of honesty.

I was promised upon signing a lease that there would be a parking lot within 5 minutes provided. Supposedly CSU pulled the rug out from under them on their parking plans. Problem with that ""get away from me"" response is, CSU is NOT 5 minutes away. It's closer to 20. Had this been the offer at lease signing, I would not have signed. But the promise was made, and the trend of saying something to appease the current situation began.

I was told I would be found a place to park for the night of move in. I was directed to a lot that was not legal to park in, and was fortunate that my car did not get towed. I was promised a phone call to right the situation. That call never came (""You have to push us"" - very promising, and impossible for someone in a serious schooling program). I've been told the Discount Tire lot is their next big stop gap (though I'm not included on that list, despite it all) - no work has been done on the lot for the last week, if at all. Very big priority, clearly. The dog and pony show doesn't work well for someone who's car came from 1000 miles away. 

I've been told everything from ""park at a friend's house,"" ""risk parking at CSU overnight,"" to ""park at this church."" The aforementioned church, is a 20 minute walk (If you are a trained runner, I suppose) in nice weather, and is a run down vagrant haven. 

Bottom line - they will tell you what you want to hear to get your money and get you to leave them alone after that. They will also fail to mention the smoking in stairways, the daily fire alarms going off, the rarely-delivered on amenities (multiple WEEKS to set up a printer? Really?), and so much more.

6/17/2017,42903,2.0,"I am writing this review as a frequent visitor to the property (I am very good friends with one of its tenants).

The building itself is visually pleasing and seems well constructed. It appears that the property owner tries hard to market the complex as a luxury, high-end community.  There are some innovative features like media / entertainment rooms and exercise facilities that are not as nice at many other suburban Philly apartment complexes. Furthermore, the location is perfectly suited to an easy commute on the Manayunk/Norristown regional rail line into Philly.

What prevents me from giving a higher rating is the extent to which I get the impression that this property is all about making as much money as possible above anything else.  My friend lived at this property for two years and paid a high amount of rent each month, but when it came time for his lease to be renewed, the management didn't just offer a modest or inflation-based rent increase ($25-50-100). They tried to up his rent by more than $500 per month! Who does that?
For the amount of money they wanted him to pay for a new lease, it was no longer worth it and he wisely chose to move on.

So to any prospective tenants of this property, you're probably okay if you only plan to stay here for a year and you'll move on when the lease is up. But don't be shocked if the building owner/property management tries to heave an unconscionably high rent increase your way if you want to be here more than a year.",1.0,Certified,44.0,2.0,0.0

The apartment I live in (A 2 bedroom Chevron) is huge and gorgeous. Everything is new. Emergency maintenance comes quickly for minor problems, but forget about major ones. They took several weeks to finally open up my wall to find a pipe leak. No one wanted to do it. They were lazy. Now I have to wait several more weeks to get them to plaster my wall, paint it, and redo my floor tiles. AND they are giving me a hard time with replacing my carpet. I had major water damage because of their busted pipe and I am the one who is treated as if it is my fault. On top of that, it is a hell of a hike to and from Manhattan, even if you use the express bus. But I must say, the express bus is mighty quiet compared to the subway. Parking is a mess. This is another area in which they leave you high and dry. It is virtually impossible to find parking due to the renovations they are doing on the garages...which has been going on for years! You can never really have guests over because they have no place to park. I am lucky enough to live across from a garage that has public parking for $8 per 12 hours. But if you live here and pay that fee, it will cost you a fortune. And sometimes they dont allow public parking and if you ask the parking attendants for a reason, they cannot give you one because they do not know themselves. Staff here are practically illiterate. No one can answer a question without giving you the run around or an attitude. Management is just horrible. On the brighter side, I live on a really quiet floor and have great neighbors. I have no problems with rats or roaches. There is a laundry facility in the basement. And it is a fairly safe neighborhood. My bedroom is right my a main road so I hear a lot of godawful rap music blasting for long lengths of time at any hour of the night. If it isnt that, then it is someone honking their horn or a car alarm going off. On another brighter note- I can go right across the street for groceries, or down a few blocks to Stop and Shop if I need a bigger supermarket. Because it is a mini-city, there are certain things that are convenient to have around, like the shopping.

I believe that his name is Kevin and that he is part of the Engineering team (if that's what the maintenance team is called at K2). I've lived in K2 for 9 months and Kevin has been a resonant force from the start. As a hospitality professional I place priority in sincerity, generosity, friendly greetings with strangers, finding solutions in the face of adversity and having a darn good memory of the people whom one interacts with. Kevin checks all of the aforementioned boxes.

Kevin is a great asset. He was quick to respond to a fire alarm issue when I first moved in and an outdoor grill issue only a couple of days ago. While these issues may seem menial, his response rate, genuine interest in addressing the problem and friendly demeanor were impactful. 

I think the best way to describe why he's been a friendly face for me during my stay is illustrated by a singular interaction: Less than a month ago I went to the concierge for a quick answer to a simple question. Her first question was- ""Do you live here?"" While I didn't show my ire with this question I haven't forgotten that feeling- Residents at K2 give a significant portion of their income to convenience, hospitality and a comfortable apartment. I felt like a stranger in my own community. I walk through the lobby and use the building's amenities on a frequent basis, but the question was posed as though I don't belong. Kevin may not know my name, but I'm sure that he'd remember every resident's name if presented with the opportunity.

A second shout-out to Crystal- a leasing agent- who also embodies hospitality and has always made herself available for all of my questions and needs. She handles everything with grace and sincere concern.

The building is conveniently located within walking distance of everywhere we need to go w/in our 'little city'; the only time we drive is to work in Tysons or to take day trips exploring.

Noise - if someone has really loud bass, you may hear it but it's barely noticeable. You also may hear a crying baby or two in the morning through the bathroom vents, but it's also only slightly noticeable. Grounds - the grass outside is mostly ""gurf/turf"" so there is little upkeep. The building looks nice from the outside. There is construction right next door that's close to wrapping up and right in front of the building is a parking lot for the construction crew. One of the best parts of the building is the pool/deck area and the view. IF another building larger than 3 stories goes up between the Rivertrace and Hudson, the appeal of the building will be eliminated. Pool/Deck - great for the summers. You can usually find a few seats by the pool without issue and the ""vibe"" around the pool is very relaxed. You can read a book in peace. There are two outdoor grills that are great - however, one of the igniter switches was broken for almost the entirety of our time there, so you needed to light it on your own with a long lighter. Gym - mostly all you need, clean, new equipment. Yoga studio - large and has plenty of videos to choose from. Bikes as well. Golf simulator - easy to set up and almost no one uses it. Concierge staff - a lot of turnover there but mostly all concierge staff are friendly and helpful. Emails when you have a package are convenient. Management/leasing staff - friendly and helpful, but if you need assistance with something quickly then you need to stop in or call. Safety - very safe neighborhood. WNY PD and Edgewater PD patrol the area consistently and with high visibility. White Rivertrace ""security"" vehicles also patrol the area 24/7.

tl;dr - BED BUGS WARNING

I moved from the east coast so had to find an apartment without seeing the actual unit and the building. True North has a fantastic yelp reviews and people at leasing office seemed very nice, so I picked an unit at True North and arranged moving. I got to the city first while the moving company is still transporting my belongings. I had a couple backpacks and a couple luggages. As I was settling down at my new potential home, found tens of scary looking bugs on the floor. At first, I didn't care because I didn't know what they are because I had never seen those before in my entire life. Later, found more in the bedroom. Found more in the closet. Found more in another closet. Something was not right. I took a close look at those bugs and googled it. Oh, no! Bed bugs. Office was closed just a few mins ago, so I called a bed bug specialist myself. The guy took a look at those little friends. Cooool, identified as bed bugs and clearly those had been there for months! Found their eggs, newborn cute baby bed bugs, hard-working daddy bed bugs, and grandpa bed bugs. The whole bed bug family was there making a happy life. Sent an email to the office staff right away. Then I booked a hotel and left without any belongings. The next day, the office called their own bed bug specialist. Nothing changed, he had the same opinion. They let me break the lease, I was released in the afternoon.

It is true that their staffs are very nice and kind, but this incident just had a too much impact on me. I had to throw away whatever I brought with me to the unit on my first day which could be at least $5,000 value. Then I spent a few days to search for an apartment. And more importantly, I started hating Seattle from the first day and still hate this city. Good thing for me, I am moving out of this city next week only after six months.

1/24/2018,43124,1.0,"This is truly an unfortunate story of a great building that used to be the bar-setter going down because of mismanagement. Don't get me wrong: some teams (namely the Concierge team) are still top notch, but many things in the last year since the Property Manager changed have been nothing short of a disaster.

I moved into NEMA on the very first day they opened 4.5 years ago and living there still; I have referred other residents and was a proud NEMAn for years, enjoying the great service.
And yet, recently it's all been going south.

Here are a few examples:

1) Twice in the past 2 months the alarm went off in the middle of the night in the top floors, as a technical mistake, forcing all residents to walk down 20+ floors after a brutal wake up just to discover it's a false alarm. No one even bothered apologizing

2) I have been unable to sleep for 3 nights straight now as a the ceiling ventilator in my unit is making terrible noise, obviously in need of cleaning or replacement. I opened 3 (!) tickets on the support system every single day and emailed the office 3 times - still did not get even a single acknowledgment that this is handled or will be handled, at some point.

3) The South Building has only 3 elevators serving 23 floors. One of them was out of service for over 2 weeks (!) which caused waiting times to be sometimes north of 20 minutes (!) just to get down to the lobby - a big problem that present serious risk to some residents. The office wasn't even apologetic about it - and blocked some elevators for private functions and move-in/move-outs - effectively leaving a 23 floors building in prime time hours with 1 elevator. Unacceptable.

4) Renewal experience has been lacking; I renewed just recently and shortly after doing so discovered that the information I was given was false, the increase I was asked to bear was way above market, and the conditions offered to me as ""very very best"" were simply lies.

I was the building #1 fan, but these days are gone. NEMA simply doesn't deliver on the promise and vision anymore which is sad and dissapointing. I can only hope this will change soon - this used to be a fantastic place to live with amazing service to count on before it went south so badly...",1.0,Silver,51.0,1.0,0.0

I have hesitated to give a review of my experience with Windmill Parc and Lerner because I am more critical about things than others might care about.  But now I feel it's about time to give my review of the apartment.

I rented a brand new 1 bedroom apartment for a year,  Price is reasonable for the area, the units are nice,  appliances are a big plus, loved the under cabinet lighting etc.,  all the wow factors that sell anyone on a tour.  Property is well kept because they have a crew that picks up the parking lots, and clean the buildings daily. So all in all nice cosmetically.

Now for a few things to keep in mind when selecting your unit.... Don't stay anywhere near the trash room, or any stairwell, these doors are very heavy and they SLAM shut, so you will hear every time anyone opens the door.  This brings me to the thin walls/ceiling.  You can hear anything that's happening out in the hallway, on my floor wasn't too much commotion, but if there is a kid running up and down the hall, or a dog barking you will hear it.  If the person upstairs is wearing shoes, has kids or a dog, you will hear them running around.  Speaking of those doors, from when I moved in till the day I moved out one of the doors in the breezeway has been broken.  Doubt they have fixed it

Parking was HORRIBLE, but has gotten a little better now that they FINALLY enforced parking a few months ago, before that you couldn't find any parking while construction on the new buildings was going on.  You would think when 100 spots or so were taken up for 2 buildings to share, that was the time to enforce parking, and nope they waited till after construction was done.

Few months into my lease I had a water leak in the bathroom wall because when the property was built someone screwed the drywall into the water supply pipe.  So they had to cut out the drywall in the bathroom to fix the leak.  Few months later I came home to a puddle of water on my kitchen floor, I thought the person above me flooded their washer.  Nope, turns out everyone above me and below me had a water leak from, what they say the building settling. As I sat on my couch I heard water spew out of the sprinkler in the bathroom.... Hrm.   Anyways they came and fixed that too and for a couple of days I had to deal with huge fans running 24/7 that took up my entire bathroom and in front of my washer/dryer.  Try sleeping behind a plane, kind of what it sounded like.

Now to the MOST important part of this review...... Lerner is a VERY money hungry company, they charge you for everything.  If you want an additional RFID tag to get access to the door for your spouse or kid, $150.  But there are ways around this, use google, save your money.  Also be sure you set an alarm in your phone to alert 60 days before you lease is up.  If you don't give them proper notice, they want to charge you 60 days' worth of rent from when you give notice,  Even if they rent out the unit, they want to charge you even though your lease is up.... Sketchy.  The staff is blah at best, Assistant manager is nice, and the rest are kind of rude.   I tried to email them and write in their dashboard reguarding the 60 days fine prior to when I found a new place to live and before my lease was up,  They never responded.  Month after my lease was up, and I have already paid for a new place to live they hit me up with a $1000 fine for giving them only 38 days notice...  So like I said,  Make a reminder.",1.0,Certified,42.0,1.0,0.0

The cleaning staff here bust her rear end cleaning and it shows, the grounds are spotless. I did take off one star on the grounds review, and it's only due to very poor lighting in the garage area. Also the parking spots are very tight. I also took off one star for noise, and that is for something the building can not control and that is the trains. My unit overlooks the tracks and can be a little annoying as they run 24/7 and have that bell and whistle going off at all hours.

3/9/2019,43533,5.0,"Still excellent (as of March 2019) - I've lived in 3 different apartments here (yes, in two years - turns out if you're allergic to carpet you really shouldn't move into an apartment with a carpet...even if it is larger and has gorgeous views) and all of them were as I described in the original review - fantastic design (not just aesthetic, functional), well thought-out, and well-kept down to the last detail. 

Current management team and maintenance (under Nicole and Nick respectively) have been great to deal with even with larger or thornier issues like the garage flood of '18(if you see the post below about the first floor of the garage flooding during rains, it happened exactly once. Bit spooky when it did, but I'm told that the drains have been upgraded and it shouldn't be possible in the future) or a neighbor playing bass at 4AM repeatedly. Both were resolved rapidly and I was given not only a resolution, but also an explanation of the plans to prevent them in the future. 

Greystar hasn't cut back on the benefits and has instead kept up the steady stream of interesting resident events and added Alfred (essentially a concierge service which has done various things ranging from the free weekly tidy-up to picking up prescriptions to having shoes taken care of and even one-off errands such as contracting with a local seamstress to replace the flax in a heating pad with jasmine rice - all at low cost, subsidized by the rent I assume but given that I haven't seen a noticeable increase I'm not complaining) which I was highly skeptical of the value of at first but now am quite a fan.

Issues I've seen (or seen in other reviews) are the following:
Fire alarms - these were truly dreadful the first few months I was here, but now we're down to once every month or two which is pretty par for the course in my book. They happen when somebody opens their door into the hall with smoke and are usually resolved within 5 minutes thanks to ACPD's speedy responses.
Elevators being out - while we did have one elevator out for months in 2017 because they didn't think to build an awning over its' opening on the roof and I do see the occasional single-elevator outage, I can only really remember being aggravated by the latter once, and I'm picky.
Trash chute not working as a door is propped open or the sensor thinks so - I've noticed this around once a month and I generate a lot of trash. The general response seems to be to either take the elevator to the first floor and put it in the bin, call the concierge and ask them to fix it - which they do promptly, or just leave the trash bag in the trash room/recycling bin. You'd think that the last would be a recipe for a stinky trash room, but thanks to the fantastic cleaning team, it stays spotless and smells amazing for a trash room. This is worth noting because that is very much not a given at other apartment complexes - the common areas, halls, etc are all kept very clean and they even shampoo the carpets from time to time.
Hot water being out - while going through my emails it looks like it's been out 4 times in 2018 (2 of which were scheduled maintainence), it looks to be getting less common over time. It's a new building, so I hope that that trend will continue as they understand the boiler and equipment better.
Never noticed a broken garage door. They tend to resolve issues very fast, so it was probably fixed before I got to it.
I've yet to live on the 12th floor, so I can't comment on the various complaints about 12th floor leaks.
In my experience, you can hear the apartment above you (not walking, the floors dampen that somehow - even with heels, but stuff like slamming doors, drilling, flushing the toilet etc), though less well than in most apartments, including the other luxury apartments around here (barring those with concrete between floors like Central Place which has its' own issues) but you can't hear your neighbors unless they're quite loud. Seems that the doors aren't 100% soundproof, but the walls are pretty good and I've yet to find better.

Overall from my experience, discussions with friends, and research on the competition, while I wish that these issues didn't exist, there's no such thing as a perfect apartment complex and none of them is a big deal in large part thanks to the management, maintenance, and cleaning crew who keep this place in good shape.

All of what I said in my original review about the awesome concierges, well-built building, smart apartment design and quiet are still true which is definitely not a given, especially the last.

I've looked into the competition in Arlington multiple times as where you live is an important decision and it's important not to get complacent, but as of now the pros and cons are the same as when I first moved in. If you want somewhere high-quality and quiet yet extremely metro-accessible in Arlington, you can't beat Latitude.

The noise from the freeway stops me from opening my windows or using my balcony. It's the main reason I won't be renewing my lease. Honestly, if I could move early, just to get away from the freeway noise, I would. Especially because they recently replaced the windows in the entire apartment, and the noise is actually worse now.

There's many grievances and perhaps my top one was that there was a foul sewage odor that pretty regularly came out of the sink of my master bathroom. When I told service about that they said ""yeah we've heard that a few times before"" but had no answers or solutions to the matter. The garage and front doors to the lobby took turns being broken for most of my 18 month lease (months of a time each of them being broken). While the interiors appear in line with the humongous price tag for rent in the area there are many things where I felt they clearly cut corners. The flooring is made of a very cheap material and many of my closet doors now get stuck a bit when I open them due to the floor warping. The sinks have flat bottoms which make them very difficult to clean and also result in water splashing up all over you whenever you wash your hands (because they are also too shallow). I am 6 foot tall, but the kitchen shelving was designed very poorly where areas are very difficult to reach for me so I'm sure impossible for most without something to step on. Some of the staff has been pleasant, but many of them have had negative attitudes and their business practices for things like picking up packages are asinine. For example, when you have to fill in intense details on paper (2018, paper?, really?) and it would take 5 minutes for me to get to leave with the package due to their system. The parking garage situation is terrible too, very small spots and no guest parking available.

In all honesty, Cirrus is run by courteous, professional staff that know how to run buildings. Kecia was my leasing agent and took care of me the whole way through. I moved from Los Angeles about a month ago and the only part that wasn't complicated was getting my unit here. All my forms, payments and documents were handled online, before I moved in. Windsor actually gets technology and forgoing the use of paper!

Approval took 10 minutes and I flew back to LA with my apartment in order. My advice is to look at every single floor plan in your price range as you'll not find a completely similar view or type floor to floor. I ended up with the smallest unit possible but the amount of outdoor space was amazing, as were my unobstructed east facing views that gave me lots of natural light. 

In terms of amenities, I actually use the upstairs space to work time-to-time, the gym is never crowded and my yoga teacher and I have used the small room for two sessions already.

My wife and I spent a year and had nothing but problem after problem...from billing issues, condition of the buildings, to unprofessional management.
1.  You will not be able to rest with the surrounding construction.  Management did a horrible job of informing residents of the noise and disturbances that have been created.  We are exhausted from not being able to sleep.  The construction begins prior to 7 AM and they have frequently had to do overnight construction on the Whole Foods parking lot deck.  
2.  They hired a young good looking but inexperienced and highly unqualified management team.  This is not the way to run a property.  The only member of the team who always was able to help or just listen to our complaints was Emily.  On a positive note, the staff who works the desk are outstanding!  This team should be the ones running the property.  Always friendly, courteous and willing to quickly solve any issues.
3.  Most concerning is the property manager, Jessica Ryan.  We have never met a more unprofessional property manager in all of our time renting in Boston and NYC.  She was rude to both my wife and I on several occasions and should not be employed in this position.
4.  Upon signing our lease we were told they have many functions for residents to get to know one another.  This is true if you are a dog and enjoy eating gourmet dog biscuits.  The best way to get to meet your neighbors is to hang out by the pool and socialize on your own.  Again, another misleading hook to get you to sign your lease.

We called the leasing agent for an appointment, and he said he would be happy to provide us with a ""maintenance worker"" to show us around since he was already booked.  We thought this was odd, but went with it.  We showed up at the appointed time and the front desk had no appointment scheduled for us despite the leasing agent guaranteeing us that they would.  We ended up waiting a half hour for said maintenance worker to arrive, but he never did.  The front desk lady blamed it on lots of move inside and scolded us for not making an appointment with leasing.  We explained to her that we HAD made an appointment with leasing but because it was our second trip the leasing agent said he would have a maintenance worker show us around.  As if this was not bad enough, the leasing agent whom we had met before walks right by us without saying a word.  I called out his name in the hopes that he would remember our appointment, he just said hello and jumped on an elevator.  We ended up leaving without seeing an apartment!!  Maybe we just caught folks having a bad day. And maybe your luck will be better.  But I can only give this place two stars.

Modern, simple, clean.  Nice residents and staff usually.  The pool/fire pit are great.  Nice location. Beautiful views from top floor with largest unit.

The Bad:
We're both early career doctors and this is not a good place for professionals who need good uninterrupted sleep.  Looks pretty but quality is poor: windows leaked multiple times into our apartment; closet rack collapsed 3 times within first 2 months of move in; gym AC was not functional (set to 73 and was always 76-78 degrees); walls are thin; neighbor frequently played loud music at 4:00 AM; other neighbor frequently smoked pot that infused the hallway and our apartment with skunk odor: said neighbor had shady people going in/out of unit who were clearly not residents (likely drug dealing since I walked out and was seriously startled by a copy ready to bust into his unit with gun drawn...); young woman across the street was murdered by the security guard on duty; both of our cars were broken into/stolen from in the parking garage; party scene - went to pool and there was vomit all over the lounge chairs; worst of all was the train noise at 2/4:00 am.  Never was told about this.  Train noise is pleasant except when you're across the street from the tracks and when you're fast asleep it wakes you up with your heart racing because it sounds like the train is running THROUGH the apartment.  No exaggeration is is THAT loud because of the way it echos with the location of the high rise.  The chronic sleep deprivation was affecting our health which is why we terminated our lease early. The property manager Rich from CDC said that they wouldn't  let us out of the lease early despite the health impact.  He also said they wouldn't report tenants to collections agencies.

I signed a lease agreement for a particular unit about a month ago, with a move-in date of 7/5/2010. A week or so later, I get an erroneous confirmation email of my move in date of 7/9/2010. I sent an email reply back that no, my move-in date is actually 7/5/2010. Didn't get a reply. A few days later though, I get a voice message on my cell phone from the Leasing Consultant, Jennifer Augment, saying she wanted to see if I had time to fill out some additional paperwork and go through an orientation and to give her a call back when I could. I tried calling her back that evening, but no answer. I tried calling the next day, then the next day after that, and time and time again, I either got her voice message or one of the secretaries picked up the phone and asked if I would like to leave a message for her. FINALLY, after several days of this, she returns my call late one evening, two weeks ago, saying she was busy and couldn't get to the phone. I was grumbling inside, but I made the effort of shrugging it off, and I first brought up the issue of the erroneous confirmation email. She says something to the effect of: ""As I stated in my voice message, the current tenant for the unit you signed your lease for decided to rescind the notice of leave, and so the apartment unit is no longer available. There was another unit available, and I asked if you were interested in it. Since I didn't hear a response from you within 72 hours, we assumed that you were ok with it, and so we have put you in the other unit."" I was like, what in God's name? She NEVER stated any such thing in her voice message to me, and I was absolutely shocked that that could even be this organization's policy. No reply in 72 hours, and they assume a ""yes?"" At the very least, she should have spoken to me in person about this issue, but she claims she left a message about it. A message I never received. Immediately, I lost trust in this whole place. I asked for my security deposit ($400) back. She asked for a moment, and then after a moment of silence she transferred me to her manager. I said, ""I don't know how much of the situation Ms. Augment filled you in on, but blah blah, I want to cancel my lease and I want my security deposit back."" He replies, ""I'm sorry, sir. That's impossible."" Now I'm like, WTF are you talking about. I reiterated I signed my lease for a particular unit and since it isn't available now I should be able to cancel my lease. He said I already had 72 hours to cancel my lease after being notified about the apartment switch. I was getting so mad, and at this point I was starting to feel like I've just been the victim of a bait and switch. After a few minutes of tense back and forth, the manager finally said he would refund the security deposit, but the $45 application fee is non-refundable. My experience is, management is very shady, and I'm glad I can put this place behind me. The location isn't really that great.

10/5/2016,42648,5.0,"It's awesome to have a Target, even one of these smaller concept stores, in Rittenhouse Square! 

Being able to have access to tons of popular products in one spot, rather than from small schlock overpriced stores, is a God-send; especially when this is your home area!

This is a bigger location, with an enhanced variety of products, than the first center city location in Washinton Square West. These are urban stores, so you can't expect them to have everything their big-box store has; but you can find most any of your essentials here, if if they aren't the exact brand that you want.

When you walk in, you start off in the clothing section, which has a nice varied selection for men and women. Then there is the food section, with a variety of fresh fruits & vegetables, dairy, frozen, and dry goods.

This is a 2-story Target, so there are stairs & elevators to get you to the second floor. There actually is a third floor they build in this building, but what it will be is apparently unknown. Perhaps it's a stock room?

On the second floor, you have a nice health & beauty section, a rather large home section, a pretty comprehensive electronics section, and other various sundries.

Unfortunately these urban stores do not have a photo lab section; maybe it's not necessary, considering all the other ways you can develop your photos, but it certainly would be nice to have if your main go-to store is Target.

There is neither a sporting section or a bike section, but don't worry: they'll have your water bottles and yoga mats here. Hahaa

Again, this is a God-send for the Rittenhouse Square area. We really needed something that has a better variety of essentials and a store that prices them reasonably here!

7/25/2018,43306,1.0,"DO NOT MOVE HERE. I can go on and on about how terrible we have been treated here, and how neglectful the management has been. On January 12th 2018, I received a phone call from the office telling me that I needed to come home immediately because the townhome next door was flooded. The townhome next to ours flooded due to a broken pipe, and caused significant water damage to our garage.Not only was the garage damaged intensely,  but our deck above was beginning to sink into the garage due to compromised structures.  We went in to the office immediately to let them know, and unfortunately overheard someone in the office tell another coworker, "" we had know those pipes needed to be replaced, and never got around to doing it""., making us extremely uneasy about the whole situation. We were then told that they were going to start repairs on the townhome first, and then would start repairs on our garage.  My fiance and I were extremely patient, and understanding since it was only our garage that had water damage, not our actual home. Two months went by with no contact at all,  so my fiance stopped by the office to inquire about repairs for our garage. We were told that they didn't know but would touch base with someone to find out. Again we patiently waited for another month will still no contact. My fiance went into the office in late April to let them know that our garage was still not fixed, and that nobody had contacted us. He let them know that we were going to be gone for most of May for a trip to Disney World, and that our dog would be elsewhere, so they can start the repairs at any time with no issues. He was again told that someone would contact us to get it repaired. Towards the middle of June, I sent an email to the office letting them know we have still not been contacted to get repairs done, and that no one has even attempted to rectify the situation. We were then contacted by the maintenance manager who said he would have someone out on June 25th to start repairs. No one ever came out to start repairs. I sent another email to the office letting them know of the issues, and instead of offering a solution, or any sort of apology or compensation, the office manager Darcie proceed to tell me that this was ""off of her desk, so it was out of her mind"", and then played the blame game on everyone else working there instead of taking responsibility. She told me that she would get someone out right away to fix out deck, but no information about the garage. She then had instructed us to move ALL of our belongings on the deck and in the garage to another vacant unit for repairs. We spent an entire Saturday moving stuff between units in hope that our garage would finally get fixed. Our deck did get fixed last week, but only after having to call the repair company back out several times to finish work they thought was complete. Still no word or work done on the garage. The last straw was when we received a phone call from the office telling us that they had signed a lease for the unit that our belongings were being stored in and we needed to leave work to come and move all our stuff out because the new tenant was moving in that day. We requested a phone call from Darcie, and was told that she would call us back as soon as possible, but that we needed to get our stuff out immediately. We then left work and move all of our stuff back into our damaged garage.  Still no repairs have been made to the garage that we have been without for 7 months, and not even an apology has been made on Arbour Squares behalf. Unfortunately we are going to have to contact a lawyer to get this rectified, because clearly we are not worth the time for the management at Arbour Square. We have done nothing but be good, easy and patient tenants, and have been treated like dirt ever since we moved in. Management is extremely neglectful and refuses to help us in any way.

9/2/2015,42249,1.0,"This place is awful. It had so much potential. Construction was basically crap so maintenance could never keep up with all the issues but poor management contributes to problems. There is new management with basically the same office people. The maintenance guy before ----- was nice but they were understaffed, now with new mgmt. company it seems worse. No improvements so far that Ive noticed. Among them: 1. Trash chute is near elevator off parking deck and ducts are not sealed on some floors allowing the garbage to stink more than it already does - on the weekends it is horrendous and the stench fills the floors. It is embarrassing to have guests come in that elevator and you have to cover your nose. I urge residents to complain to http://www.sandyspringsga.org/city-services/urban-developme because it is not a sanitary way to live. Yet of course they bill us the required $35 valet trash fee without a hitch. 2. No recycling. Been promised recycling since I moved in months ago and I have to take things I want to recycle to the Sandy Springs municipal . Serious this is 2015, how can a brand new building be so environmentally irresponsible. Again, they bill us $35 fee for valet trash but can't contract for recycling services. This should be a law but unfortunately in GA its not.. 3. Another promise was tv service on the machines in the gym. Like the recycling people office keeps making excuses and it never happens. 4. Saturday morning breakfasts stopped which was another one of the false selling points. Guess its not in the new management company's budget. It was pretty lame anyway. Resident events are few and far between, again another selling point, cooking classes in the club area that never happened. When they did have events they were always too early for people who work 9-5 to make them anyway - because office staff did not want to work late. Can't understand why they can't have a rotation like in my old building where a staff member comes in late that day to help out with the event a little later. 5. Hallways, parking deck areas are rarely maintained and cleaned. If you walk the hallways you will see pee stains from dogs on carpeting and broken up walls. I live on 5 but when I walk to the parking deck you see them. They only keep the first floor hallways nice because that's where the model is so most likely to be seen by potential renters. 6. If you want to duplicate your key to your apartment its a special fob type key so it costs $50 per key. 7.. Security is weak. Many doors are left open. The Sandy Springs police officer who lived here left and went to another community. Who can blame him, someone stuck a rag in his gas tank and lit it on fire - thank the lord it did not blow up because who knows what would have happened with other cars next to it. Google it and you will find the news reports. Still hardly any cameras in the parking deck, Not sure about who is doing security now but the spot where the police officer parked is vacant. There was at least one break in on the 4th floor and the guys door is still banged up, maintenance couldn't even fix that, after what they went through.... I am sure there were more that I do not know about. 8. Lots of issues with apartments when you move in, again, construction was a mess, paint is a mess, color scheme on brown cabinet floors (even floors) doesn't match, cement floors on balcony (and in parking deck for that matter) look like drop cloths 9. Visitor access is inconvenient . The callboxes are either near the leasing office which is no where near visitor parking or by the smelly elevator which requires a fob anyway to use. They can enter the hallway and walk to the elevator by the leasing office but again it is far and confusing - you will have to go down to greet your guests. There is no callback at the parking gate 10. Level 1 parking is reserved for ""office parking"" and is before gate. So if you choose a first level apartment , you will likely have to park on another level or park in a spot that says office parking only. AFAIK, they don't enforce it but still have to think about the potential of your car being towed for parking at home sucks. I can go on and on but I think you get the idea. And the positives, the kitchens are nice, the pool area is nice, the jacuzzi near the gym is nice, the location is good Bottom line is that Associated Estates should have sued the construction company for shoddy construction, instead they sold out to another management company and the tenants get screwed!",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

6/5/2018,43256,5.0,"I highly recommend the Avant. 

TL;DR Only two negatives: Unsecured parking garage and it's shared with retail space. Also the rooftop space is used for a dog park, inexplicably there's no place for residents to sit/layout/enjoy. 


1. Security 

This building is secure. There's ""fob"" access into the lobby AND fob access on the elevators WHICH I ADORED. Since we're in such a pedestrian friendly area more than a few people followed someone through the lobby door. But once they sneak past the concierge onto the elevator they find themselves stuck, because you need a key to select *any* floor. It helped avoid a few awkward situations when someone literally forced their way in behind you. This security also was reassuring from the public access garage residents park in. We're in an area with a lot of bars/restaurants, so naturally at 12 AM it's not unusual to see people wandering/stumbling through the garage. The bar patrons regularly chose the resident only elevator vs public elevator. I don't blame ppl for being confused - the garage is not well done. Fortunately once they're on, if they don't have a key they cant select the ""lobby"" floor to enter the Avant after business hours.

2. The staff 

From the leasing office, to the maintenance team, to the front desk staff everyone was amazing. 
The maintenance team holds a special place for me because they reported seeing suspicious activity around my car & they were right to report it! It was such a relief to feel like you're in a community that looks out for each other. 
The front desk staff - one in particular is SO PROFESSIONAL. His conversations were always polite, but never prying. He never overstepped the professional conceriege-resident relationship!
The leasing staff are always there to help! I had a particularly large christmas present that needed to be wrapped away from prying eyes. They allowed me space in their offices to wrap christmas presents & helped source materials to finish the job. 

3. Parking- the only negative about this entire experience. The parking lot leaves a lot to be desired (a car was stolen/things were stolen from cars/bikes were stolen) because it is *not* secure. The parking is shared with retail. Of course, as a resident you have reserved parking on whichever level you decide to pay for, but the most expensive/convenient level is also the one most vulnerable to the public. There is a flimsy bar that stops cars from turning into the Avant's parking section, but there's no solid wall or gate (so if someone really wants to enter or leave it's very possible). 
As a pedestrian there's nothing stopping them from walking amongst the resident's cars. More than a few times I came downstairs to people taking pictures of the cars, I get it they're cool cars you don't see everywhere, but it's still unnerving. 

4. Unit location

I thought it was worth paying a bit more to get a view of RTC, and if you can swing it, get an apartment that lets you see the Mountains too! Your sunsets will be spectacular. 

5. Apartments

The PH level(s) here had finishes that I actually liked less than the bottom floors, however their ceiling height is really nice. I was fortunate to have a unit with a fridge complete with ice dispenser and filtered water. After living in a few luxury Bozzuto communities I realize how rare that fridge is now. The closet space was massive and the master bathrooms were actually master bathrooms (storage/dual vanity/space).

6. RTC

I know that Boston Properties recently came into a bit of bad press because of charging for retail parking. While I lived there I loved living in a BP neighborhood. As soon as it began to snow cleaning cruises were salting and paving the sidewalks. They didn't even wait for snow to accumulate. The flowers were watered like clockwork every morning and it's generally a pleasant place to live.

7. Running/Biking

Great place to be a runner or biker. You're right off the WO&D trail and the Potomac River Running store has weekly running groups. Also there's an incredible Bike shop next door that has some very legitimate bikes to rent out and sell to you!

I asked to see studio and one-bedroom apartments and he told me he only has one-bedroom apartments available and no studio was available to show until end of this March, which seems a little absurd for a big apartment building and given that all the other placed nearby had studios to show, I wonder if he was being truthful. 

He showed me two one-bedroom layouts and said the elevator wasn't available and I followed him to walk up five flights of stairs, he asked me about my budget and where else I was going to see and when I mentioned another building that has a higher price range than my budgeted range, he said ""I don't understand you, they are more expensive than us."" It is completely my right to decide and I didn't need his judgement.

My apartment facing the water would leak cold air by the air conditioning unit. I had to tape it with electrical tape to keep it from being too cold or cranking the heat. When you walk in the hallways you can hear all the conversations from the apartment so I can hear my neighbor having relations sometimes when I got home. Luckily I think the relationship went beyond that first spark since the frequency decreased with passing months. People drink on this property! So it is good to be social or bad if your a little older. The extras add up. And by contract we were supposed to cover the floor with carpet with some high % number. We never did so maybe that is why we had issues with the flooring.

They do try to cover it up with blowing air fresheners and large fans, but clearly nothing works, also note this will never be fixed it's been since March and here we are in August. And the head management guy Michael informed me it was a flaw of the buildings design, so try not to be embarrassed when you bring friends over to visit. 

I've lived in other high rises and this is by far the worst one. It's not full service at all, if you even ask the door staff to do anything you seem as though you're being an inconvenience (besides Moses). Don't expect a smile from anyone when you walk-in. It was actually hard for me to leave my last building because I did love the door staff so much, so I was quite shocked here when I realized 1 out of the 4 are friendly. Don't even get me started on how whenever guest show up they have to call me to come down because no one is ever at the desk. They do have an entrance system when you walk up to the door outside on the far left (just hope the leasing staff informed you of this and you're signed up) but most people when they visit a building like this would assume they would check-in with the door staff. Also note that the door staff when you come during business hours is the leasing staff so don't expect any more out of them you should actually expect less. Side note, expect the leasing staff to be incompetent and your move-in to not be flawless in anyway, because I bet you a million dollars they didn't even know you were moving in the day you were scheduled. They say they're really sorry and the only reason things are not in order is because they're trying to sell the building. Well good luck with that, I would hope no idiot would buy this place unless they're trying to fix the management team aka Michael and the garbage smell in the lobby everyone just loves to walk home to.

For packages you have delivered expect some to be misplaced because they have a parcel system of lockers and if it's full they just leave packages on top of the mailboxes where anyone could grab them. 

For elevator wait times you want to pray it's not a move-in day so 1 of the 3 elevators is down and that 1 of the 2 elevators left isn't broken for the day. Because I've waited up to 10 minutes for an elevator. I use the stairs here more than the elevator because they are so slow. 

If you're used to other high rises disposing of your large cardboard boxes and other things that can't fit down the chute you can expect to not expect that here. My previous building I would just place them by the chute door and the buildings night team would pick up and dispose of that for you. Here you're expected to go down to the first floor (the smelly garbage floor aka lobby/hope the elevator doesn't take too long) and go to the loading dock half a block down and dispose of everything yourself. Just little things like this make you realize this building is different than most for what you're paying. 

The only reason I'm giving this building any stars is because of the location and the maintenance staff. Other than that I can't wait for my lease to be up so I can actually move back to a full amenity building for the price point I'm paying. I really did want to love this building because the location is so great, but just thought I would inform future renters what they can expect if they move here. They've been trying to sell the building, so let's hope if they do they have better management.",1.0,Silver,54.0,1.0,0.0

The office staff was friendly and ready to help me with anything I needed. The two studios that I looked at today were really nice I looked at one in building 2 and the other in building 1. They were both very clean and well kept. Building 2 comes with stainless steel appliances and granite counter tops while building 1 has white appliances. The only downside besides the price is that building 1 doesn't have washer and dryers in the apartments, you have to use the washer and dryers on your floor. Now about the price, its a little steep at 1,585 for their smallest studio and 1,660 for a little larger in building 2. You are defiantly getting what you pay for. Its a pretty place and it have an amazing workout room and a nice media room. Also, you have to have a key to get into the building so you know you are safe inside. Now, a couple downside besides not being able to have washer and dryer in the rooms in building 1 is that you can't have a pet besides a cat which is 50 extra a month, you pay 80 a month for parking, and the fact that it seems more like a college dorm than an apartment complex.

Residents have been told to expect rents to increase $500 on the renovated units. (It's already moving that way--I got notified that my rent is going up $100 per month, and my apartment hasn't even been renovated.) I want some of whatever hallucinogenic substances AIMCO is ingesting if they seriously think they are going to get those kinds of rents--UNLESS they make some serious efforts to improve the things that are wrong with the place that people are kind of willing to put up with because the rents are fairly modest--a shuttle service that rarely runs on time, the constant need for repairs (I've been here 10 months; we've had at least a dozen days so far when the water has been cut off for repairs; it's off again as I type this), lack of hot water at certain times of the day. People paying $1,600 for a one-bedroom apartment, which is what I'm hearing they're expecting to charge, are going to insist on better than that. I don't care how beautiful they make the units, if residents can't count on basic services that are promised, they're not going to pay that kind of rent when there are other options nearby. In the meantime, the construction is quite an inconvenience for the current residents--far more than it needs to be, because management seems to me to have made very little effort to minimize the disruptiveness. I lived here 15 years ago; it was not like this then--it was a very nice place to live--and so when I needed to come back to the area and find housing on short notice, Riverside was an obvious choice.

Contractors entered apartments without prior notice; some residents were burglarized because contractors left doors open routinely. The faulty installation of kitchen cabinets and fan coil units produced pathways for mice and roaches. Some apartments were ravaged with black mold; the building´s gates were constantly left open; and 24 hour security was briefly curtailed. Oh, did I mention the series of arsons that disabled two of the building´s four elevators?  Many long time residents have moved out.

That being said - Ink Block is far and away the worst living experience of my life.  And I've lived in luxury buildings in Chicago, LA and NYC for the last 10 years.  

To start, the management staff is filled with children who don't know how to conduct themselves professionally yet.  They dress for work as though they're going to the club.  They are arrogant, rude, and ultimately do not resolve tenant issues the way you would expect for paying 3k - 4k per month in rent.  

For example, there have been multiple fires since I've moved in.  If your unit was effected by the sprinklers water damage they will put high powered blowers in your unit - using your outlets, and they will not reimburse the increase in your electrical costs (which is astronomical).  Something that they should be working together with tenants to submit to Ink Blocks insurance.

Further, they communicated that there would be a month or two worth of construction upon moving in - 11 months later and there's been construction every morning beginning at 6:30am.  Construction is taking place not only across the street and behind our building for the Marriott, but within the building as well, as they build out the restaurants and store fronts for leasing.  This is absolute insanity for current residents.

The floor plan that we communicated with them about looked to have much more storage than what we moved into so we had to spend an additional $65 a month to rent a storage unit on top of our $1700+ rent.

When I tried out the oven after about a month, it filled the apartment with smoke; it took three visits from maintenance before they finally replaced it. There were two fires in a year, one was in a vacant unit. The water and/or electricity was out at least once a month. The ceiling in my bathroom nearly caved in because of a leak in the unit above mine, which they claimed they couldn't find even though I could hear it until the day I moved out. The management is always looking for ways to nickel-and-dime the tenants. Their latest gambit is a $5/month parking fee. I know it's small, but there's absolutely no reason for it - the parking lot is huge and there's never a problem finding a spot. That was one of the reasons I moved there in the first place. Complaints are regarded with a ""if you don't like it, you can leave"" attitude. So I did. Don't get me wrong, there are positives to this place. The people in my building were very nice and friendly, I never had a problem with any noise, pets, or excessive drugs. Management did do a good job of clearing the lot after Snowpocalypse. There's a free shuttle to the metro during rush hour, which is nice because it 's a 20-25min walk. Old Town is about the same distance, but there's no shuttle. The view of DC was nice and watching beltway traffic had a zen-like quality.

All 3 buildings are constructed so cheaply that I could build a wooden shack that would hold up better than the construction quality used. Want to hear your neighbors and walk up 43 flights of stairs and notice strange people wandering the halls every day?!? Well then look no further! 

Floors are completely buckled due to laminate finishes, bathtub tiles have plastic falling down drain, dishwasher was placed in wrong location causing a giant hole in the wall when you open it, dishwasher flooded and ruined floors and a new $300 rug. We just moved in here to this brand new building. Hallways are 20 degrees cold, elevators break, the finishing here are cheaper than any building I've ever lived in. I've visited friends who pay $800 each in The Heights and their floors and appliances are better quality than here. A flood, 6 broken heaters, dishwasher replaced, broken shower head and a few splinters from the cheap floors. Not to mention, nothing ever dropped on floors just from simply vacuuming. $3800 for what seems to be the quality of an affordable housing unit appliance wise. JUNK! This place is seriously a Ford Pinto deceiving you into thinking you're living luxury living Tesla. 
This building is 6 weeks old and the laundry list of problems continues, oh and the washer and dryer pump needs to be replaced too.

Good pre-read if you are thinking about moving here: http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/315-on-a-coffee-machine Overall the apartments are very nice and built to LEED certification. Closet space is a bit lacking but views especially in the higher units makeup for the slight lack of space. The community overall has been very nice with a significant amount of residents owning dogs. The building itself is very pet friendly with a dedicated dog relief area in the parking lot.

The front entrance is also going downhill with a clutter of clipboards for packages, guest sign-in and zipcar signin sheets which could all easily go away given the number of monitors and computers behind the desk. These computers seem to be used mostly for concierge staff to watch youtube. The building was always non-smoking but we are now confronted with a number of folks smoking in the garage, on balconies and by the entryway.

3/29/2011,40631,1.0,"Yes it's true - There is a major misprint on the giant sign so prominently displayed on the side of tower 1. You will not ""love what's inside,"" rather, you will loathe it. I moved into Tower 2 in 2007 because I was right out of college and my roommate and I needed a cheap place. Riverside seemed decent enough for the price, but in the 3 years I lived there, the rent for my 2br went up from just under $1200/mo to almost $1600 a month. Granted, I understand the economy stinks and that inflation probably has something to do with the raise in rent, but for that kind of money, you'd think that management would use it for upgrading the apartments something. Let's see...They put some new couches in the lobby right before I moved out, they haphazardly painted the hallways a couple of times a year, raised the price of laundry from $1.60 to $2 per load over the years I was there. That's $2 to wash and another $2 to dry and there was no guarantee that the machines would even work and no way to get your $ back if something malfunctioned. Let's see what else? Oh! Parking was free at first but in 2010, management gave people the privilage of paying for an uncovered reserved parking spot for $25 a month because people in Tower 1 (the rennovated tower) asked for it at their building. When enough people weren't dumb enough to buy them, management decided to start charging everyone for parking. Also, be aware that management has some sort of cozy deal with Dominion Towing and generates extra revenue by towing resident's cars unsuspectedly park in someone's unmarked reserved spot. Speaking of which, I woke up one Saturday morning last summer, went out to the parking lot and found my car to be missing. I about had a heart attack and assumed my car had been stolen, so I called 911 and reported a car theft. What I found out had happened was that the complex had towed my car for having an expired VA inspection sticker on it. OK, so my sticker was overdue by a couple of days, you caught me, but at the time I was riding Metro to work and used my car maybe once a week to go to the store. But the bigger issue is asking how the hell is it within Riverside's purvue of authority to tow someone's car for that? For me, that was the last straw. Also, the secrity system is a joke. I'm sure that the key fob entrance to the complex and the buildings seems like a good idea during your tour, but if you want to order in delivery to your apartment, guess what your delivery guy doesn't have. A key fob. I would say that 1/10 of the times I ordered dinner the person would actually come to my door. The other times, I'd get a call saying ""hi I 'm here can you come down and let me into the building?"" So then you have to walk down to the elevator, wait 10 minutes for one to show up, ride it downstairs to the lobby and what do you find? That's right, your pizza/chinese or whatever is in the lobby because someone had let them in during the 10 minutes you spent riding downstairs. Needless to say, there went the guy's tip. Final thoughts: there are some good eggs on management but overall, they seriously went downhill over the 3 years I lived there; Leasing began moving way too many rif-raff into the complex; and my neighbors across the hall were about as shady as you could get.

6/27/2003,37799,3.0,"Having lived at Riverside Park four years, I´ve seen my share of the good and the bad. There is room for some legitimate complaining, but the bottom line is it´s one of the most affordable apartments in the area, considering what you get. Three of the biggest problems in the last four years seemed to have subsided. They were: the nearly three-year balcony replacement project, the problems with elevators and subsequent renovations, and the hot water problems (in Building 3, though I suspect elsewhere). The management that took over in early 2003 has been very apologetic, though not entirely responsive. Having established a new resident relations office, things have gotten better. Those problems were mere inconveniences, however. Based on my experience, the complex tends to be safe, pest-free, noise free, and responsive with maintenence requests. While there have been complaints about receiving packages, I´ve never missed one in four years of receiving three to four a month. (I´m an ebay freak.) And, again, the new resident relations office now allows packages to be picked up almost all day, every day, which is a vast improvement over the previous pickup hours. Many residents frequently complain about the office staff, and sure, they´re not great, but I think they try to be pleasant and helpful when they can. They certainly could be a little more organized and a little more understanding. My favorite parts of Riverside: the swimming pools, ample parking and shuttle bus to the Metro station. I would never expect something this nice for less than $900 a month.  My sympathies go out to anyone who has been stranded on a balcony, experienced a leaky ceiling, or not had a working air conditioner. I´ve never had such an experience and nor have most of my neighbors. But maybe we´re just lucky.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

As my delightfully eccentric friend (and current resident for over a year) put it: if this place actually sold units, she would make an offer.

I've now toured around many / most of the liveable high-rises downtown. This place seems to be the sweet spot for rentals, if you can afford it.

Down-sides:
* The views aren't all lovely lovely lovely.
* It's expensive
* The tub and pool close at 10

Up-sides:
* It's super close to San Pedro Square, downtown SJ, etc

* It has an awesome location
* It has a pool
* It has a hot tub
* The gym is really good, relative to other high rise gyms I've seen in the area

I've seen some places downtown where the apartments are nice but for example the hallways are dim and dingy; sometimes they skimp on hallway A/C, or hallway carpeting is sub par. All of the common areas in this place are really great though. Hallways are cool, clean, and well-lit.

Randolph Tower was definitely our first choice, we just didn't know it until we saw it. It's the most unique and well designed complex in Chicago and there's amazing history to boot. Randolph Tower was built in 1929 and was formerly known as the Steuben Club, hangout to John Dillinger. Dillinger's coat-check girlfriend, played by Marion Cotillard in Public Enemies, worked here. Village Green rescued the building and restored the terra-cotta exterior, which should be done in November, and renovated the interior with modern conveniences. Whoever the interior designer is did a remarkable job and has a great eye for color.

It had been vacated a month or more before I moved in. That same weekend, there was a murder in an apartment 1 floor above me. Bedbugs are 10x harder to eliminate then any other type of infestation. THE WORST thing you could do is to remove all your ""old"" furniture with out ensuring that the bed bug problem has been eliminated. This is by far the quickest and most common way to spread the infestation through out your apartment, home or BUILDING!!! Bed bugs will simply fall out of the infested items and travel around laying eggs until they find a new host location. Bed bugs can live up to 1 year with out food(blood) from a host, females lay about 12 eggs everyday. when you throw out infested items you cause a greater problem. I eliminated my roach and bug problem with powdered Boric Acid. $20 for a HUGE bottle. I laid it around the edges of the apartment, sprinkled it on the rug and furniture and I no longer have bed bugs. I also do not have roaches. after a week i vacuumed up the boric acid in the carpet and reapplied the treatment once a week for a month. After the month was up, I vacuumed and reapplied a thin line of BC along the edges of the apartment and have been bed bug and roach free since April 2007. Boric Acid is non-toxic, i have two cats and both are a live and well. The building is a mess. Tenants leave trash in the hall ways, and on the floor of the trash chute room. They pour old, spoiled food directly into the trash chute (that's why we have a roach problem). The grocery store price gouges, each cashier comes up with different prices for items and the restaurant adds a 10 percent tax to all the food.

The buildings were beautiful, the small parks in the interior of the grounds were serene and had a peaceful atmosphere, and the building's security measures seem effective. However the area immediately beyond the grounds, starting at the police station and getting exceptionally worse past that, is some of the most dangerous parts of San Francisco. It was a miracle I was not mugged or assaulted while there for the year. During daytime, two close friends/roommates were mugged by two young men, and one of those friends received a concussion within a block of the entrance. Another roommate was mugged at knifepoint. Several friends who live in the complex also told me of their encounters with the hoodlums in the area. All in all, not a completely safe place to be in the day time. Can be extremely dangerous at night, without the safety of numbers. Single women are especially vulnerable in this area. Besides that, lack of noticeable staff, and the generally overpriced nature of San Francisco apartments, Filmore center is a reasonably nice complex that has, at the least, basic necessities that would be more than enough to live comfortably in a condensed city environment. If it weren't for the extremely high chance of being assaulted. This may seem like an unbalanced gripe, but it is a very serious reality, that is very possible. It's a shame, because Filmore is a decent complex, and is not at direct fault (Although I have rarely seen any staff patrolling the facility, never mind security of any kind). But it is not an environment I could recommend. Mind you this is the block closest to the San Francisco Police Department. The main building is in a safer area.

10/23/2007,39378,1.0,"This place is not worth the money. It's too expensive to be living in the ------. Repairs take forever, and fees and charges keep going up. Our friends who also live in this bldg. had their rent go up over $100 dollars the second yr. This is ridiculous. So much money for so little. It took several weeks for them to fix our sink, that was broken when we moved in. There was also a hole in the wall when we moved in and they refused to fix it, even telling my partner it was our responsibility to fix this whole in the wall. Parking is goin up to $210, why? Because they say it is so costly to maintain the garages. Maintain what? My fob takes several swipes to work. There is water seeping in from the ceiling that drips on you. I never see security. And periodically I have gotten passed the gate onlt to find someone has parked in front of the exit, or partially blocking it. Just yesterday it was a girl in a car, and I honked several times, and she woudn't move out of the garage exit. I mean, what is wrong with people here? But the main point is, why does it cost so much for parking, and why did it go up? It doesn't make sense. The dorr-fobs didn't work one night, so a group of us couldn't get in the bldg, luckily someone called up to a friend with their window open. Once we got inside we called the Courtesy Patrol to let them know the door is broken, and he said he saw us out there, but was busy. SO, he knew the door was broken and was just letting people wait til someone either left the bldg or what? Wait to get mugged and harrassed by the thugs and homeless on the street. They didn't even post a note saying call this number and they can remotely buzz you in. Of course, he didn't bother to remotely buzz in the group that had formed there. So, we are paying money to live here, and they can't even be bothered to let us into our apts. Or another solution might have been to put one of the security people there to let people in as they come home. People leave their trash in the hallways, it's disgusting, and they leave the door to the trash cute open all the time, which basically makes the whole floor smell like it is a dumpster. It's so gross and disrespectful. We had guests over, and they commented and asked why the hallway smelled so bad. There have been several notes put up telling people that they should shut the chute door, but they keep doin it. I don't know if it's because they are being belligerent or just jerks. I don't get it, do they like having an apt that smells like trash? The homeless get into the bldg somehow, and we've seen security have to escort them out. So, in turn, this means this place isn't that secure. Our friends have had their car broken into twice since we moved here. We opted for the ""secure"" parking, which is a jip. Every spot is a compact spot, and it takes several attempts just to get my car in the spot. There is a junk-heap right by the door, which should be towed away, it just sits there. Plus, some guy in a Boxster takes up 2 spots regularly, which is just indicative of how people here are rude and could care less that they live amongst other people. Today some guy put his cigarette out on the wall in the lobby right in front of us. The people here are ------, and ruin what, on the outside, looks like a nice place. This place isn't safe either. It is too close to the projects, and the nastiness that spills forth out of it. When my partner leaves to go to the Safeway, I tell him, ""Be Careful!"" We moved here from NYC, and I NEVER had to worry about our safety there like I worry about it here. The noise. We are right on Fillmore, and the million dollar condo bldg across the street makes it so the noise reverberates, and bounces off the bldg and echoes right into your window, Even being on the upper floors, a skateboard on the street sounds like it is right outside your window. We hear prostitutes fight in the middle of the night, then to find chunks of hairweave on the sidewalk in the morning. There are homeless yelling their insane babble at all hours. Plus, some jackass now has a windchime goin, so when you're trying to watch TV, all you hear is ringing from their window. People just throw there unwanted mail on the lobby floor. People here are just slobs. Plus, in the laundry room. People will take up every machine for themselves. One person for all those machines. Thats just mean and selfish. But do they care, no. They are nasty. We have a cat, and a month after we moved in the pet rent went up because they said it was becoming too costly to take care of the dog-run. What maintenance does a dog-run take? But, the issue is, WE HAVE A CAT, not a DOG. why am I paying a pet rent for an animal I dont have. This makes no sense to me. They are currently building the new Yoshi's across the street. So anyone who doesn't work 9-5 or is up early, is greeted in the early hours by jakchammers and industrial equipment constantly beeping while it backs up. It's non-stop. Plus, the sirens running up and down fillmore are blisteringly loud. I know the bldg can't help this, but if the area were safer, then there would be less police-sirens and ambulances. We have been here for many months now, and our name still isn't on the call box outside. Thus visitors or deliveries can't get ahold of us when they should be able to. Our friends have to then call us and we have to go down and get them. What is the use of having a call box if they never update it.

5/28/2012,41057,4.0,"ve lived here for three years, and I switched apartments from a studio to a 2 bedroom halfway through. Both have been fine. The kitchen in the studio was miniscule, but the rest of the place (it was the largest of the three studio floor plans) was huge. The two bedroom is really roomy, and our view is amazing. Things I like: Really nice gym with a cardio room, group exercise room, weight room, and a lounge area with a pool table & TVs. (I wish it was included in everyone's rent, though. Only building -- the pricier one-- 1 gets it for free. The other two have to pay $40/month, but it's still way cheaper than joining a gym & it's harder for me to be lazy when all I have to do is cross the parking lot). Convenience store downstairs (building 2) Dry cleaner in the lobby (I've never used it but if you have things dry cleaned that would be handy) Never had any bug or mouse issues (I'm on a high floor. Maybe the people who have had problems are lower? I've seen a roach now & then in the lobby & the sidewalk outside is covered with them in the summer). Maintenance is usually really quick to respond (though checking ""by appointment only"" on the online form is pointless & they will just come pounding on your door at 8:00am regardless. No amount of ""just a minute!!"" ever seems to help & luckily I keep the chain on when I'm working from home in my pajamas). Everything seems to be kept up pretty well. Huge parking lot. There's never a problem finding a spot. You can get a reserved one for $25 a month or something, but I don't really see the point. Things I don't like: The manager (?) in the leasing office is so arrogant & rude. I've had several run-ins with him & I can tell that the leasing agents can't stand him. The leasing process was a nightmare... both times. I am a freelancer so I had to jump through a million hoops to verify my income, and when I'd bring in what they told me, I'd get there & it would be the wrong thing all of a sudden. The entire process took way longer than it should have. When I moved from one apartment in the building to another I had to reapply again as if I'd never lived there. I had to pay close to $1000 to break my lease to move to another apartment within the same building, provide mail to show my proof of residence (I live HERE!!). There are so many details I've forgotten now but I can tell you that both times I applied it was way more difficult than it needed to be. The move-out process is weird. You have to get your carpets professionally cleaned & show the receipt upon move out. I HIGHLY advise doing the walk-through with the maintenance people, though I kept calling to make an appointment to do so last time & their voice mail was full for about two weeks & I could never get hold of them (It's a different process than requesting maintenance service, which is an online form & that works great). Anyway, they ended up charging me $250 for a supposed scratch on the approx. 2 square foot formica counter in my kitchen. I doubt that much formica costs $250 and I'm quite sure they didn't even change it. Central heat & air would be nice, especially in the larger apartments. The things on the wall work fine when you're within a few feet, but the bathroom & halls & kitchen get pretty toasty in the summer. Overall, this is the nicest place I've lived. I'm a musician & I don't make much money, so maybe if your tastes are snootier than mine you will be dissatisfied, but I've always felt safe and comfortable, and it's the biggest bang for your buck anywhere around here.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,1.0

We have lived in several apartment buildings on the Upper West Side over the past few years that are described as luxury buildings - finally we have found a building that warrants the description. 

Equity Apartments has a very easy application process.  We visited the apartment several times before moving in and the leasing manager, Olivia could not have been more helpful in answering our questions and following up on some questions / requests we had.  Overall, this was the most straightforward lease application we have gone through.

When we first saw the building (when passing by during construction) we were not sure what to think - with its exoskeletal design.  Now, as residents, we are very happy with all the natural light and modern conveniences that most newer buildings have (washer/dryer, gym, golf simulator, pet spa, conference room etc etc).  Bathrooms and kitchens are spacious (by NYC standards) and the fixtures are good quality. Management is also planning for resident events during the warmer months which gives the building a nice vibe.

They claim to have an ""open door"" policy, so sure you can call and complain all you want. But they won't do anything. I've never lived in such a horrible apartment complex (and I've lived in several). My problems here triple all of the problems I've had everywhere else combined. I moved in thinking I am not as nit-picky as many of the reviewers are. Nope, it's all true. And it's all really awful. There are cockroaches, spiders, pigeons that poop everywhere on your balcony and in your a/c wall unit and worst of all, MICE! They die in the walls and stink. I actually saw a dead mouse in the elevator yesterday. And maintenance and their contracted pest company are not equipped to handle any of it. Maintenance in general is just a joke. They don't really ""fix"" anything - just find a temporary solution to get by. Then they'll track dirt onto your carpet and damage things that I'll probably be charged-for when I move out.

Pros: 
1. New, for someone like me (especially Dont like old washer/dryer), its perfect!
2. Location is great! If you live alone the McDonald's, potbelly and starbucks down there is quite helpful!
3. Nice Hallway, absolutely no smelly trash room. Someone put trash there sometimes because the pick-up in progress light is kind of long sometime, but it got cleaned out pretty fast.
4. Office staff are nice and friendly and they are willing to solve any problem you have. 
5. Concierge/maintenance are fairly experienced.
6. Roof top and common room are fabulous to stay.

Cons:

1. comparably speaking, they are quite expensive apartment. I got to choose from here and two at the downtown waterfront and they are actually cheaper than  this one. I only chose this one because its closer than my work place and the wood floor (those had carpet on and i sometimes allergy to carpets)

2. Office hour need to be ""fixed"". As I said, office staff are very nice and friendly. but I do found out they sometimes dont follow the office hour. I think they can certainly got off work earlier or open office later because i do appreciate their work, but they should change that on websites or when they cannot stay late they should put a notice in the building somewhere because I found its quite difficult for me to find them at office hour, especially at the beginning and end of the day. 
(around 10:00-11:00am on Sundays and 9:00-9:30, 6:00-7:00pm on weekdays. I have go to work at 9:30 and normally back home around 6:00 and sometimes I personally cannot see office staff for the whole week and when i need to see them personally i have to go home earlier. 

3. Like Garret said, wall is a little thin. When I moved in i specifically asked about the walls and floors. So far I cannot hear any noise from upstair. But before I was gonna write review against Garret because the fact i did not heard any noises, now i am wrong. When i have neighbors both sides...yes I actually can hear them. but The noise go through the walls are reasonable. Most of the time I can hear it if next door close their cabinet very hard or their guest knock their door hard.

But the trouble is the windows. Most of the studios and apartment might share a window(one piece glass in two rooms). The gap between the window and the wall could be very annoying and the fact i can hear my next door have sex 1:00 am in the morning. I dont care if i can heard they talk about what to eat for dinner but not SEX...thats way too much and awkward. 
But as Garret wrote, the office can do something to your window so the noise is reasonable. Now I dont have to hear those conversation and bed talk, and all i can hear is when they close their windows because we share a glass that just not avoidable.


Suggestions

1: I hope they can hire more front desk concierge. Right now we got Eric, super nice friendly and sweet boy there all the time but not Tuesdays and Wednesdays. I hope they can have a part-time concierge there.
2: And also pay more attention to the furniture at  the roof top and common room. Seattle rains a lot, and the furnitures left outside at the roof top and common room are too pity to see. They just got washed over and over when it rains, and blow dry with wind or sunshine....I hope they have a cover.
3: Please....Accept credit cards sooner:P

Thats all my experience with Coppins Well and I certainly would recommend this building to new guests and renters. Pretty new building and i dont know anyone is moving out so i m not sure about their deposit (As a problem almost every renter has for other places, you never be able to get your ""Deposit"" back.)

However, during the winter months, be prepared to roast in your apartment. During the Thanksgiving when the weather was a bit balmy, I probably lost at least 10 pounds from sweating in my kitchen and throughout the entire apartment. You would think that these idiots would have the maintenance people to adjust the temperature control so that people would not have to suffer during the winter months with heat. Yes, you pretty much have to open your sliding windows to let in the cold air to combat the sweltering heat, so much for energy conservation, but that becomes their problem. I have noticed a slight improvement in the heat, somewhat, finally, over the last week or so, perhaps maybe because of the cooler temperatures, I do not know. I hope that is a positive improvement from some of the other obvious complaints about this. It is a shame you transition from the heat outdoors during summer months only to have soaring temperatures in your apartment during the winter. It is a damn shame!

Look at the AMAZING amenities Greystar has been providing--and continues to provide--the many residents of OCB, who pay plenty in rent and bogus ancillary fees month after month!

Good thing they've also got a top-notch security company that's fantastic at ruining evenings for residents but does nothing to stop vagrants from stealing shit out of our cars or sleeping in our lobbies.

That doesn't add up. Both of those statements cannot be true.

If the goal is ""to provide the best possible experience for anyone we interact with, whether they end up leasing with us or not"" then creating a prospect file on anyone who calls is not going to make everyone happy.

What I didn't mention earlier is that texting me out of the blue several weeks later is seriously betting on a long shot.  Good odds at being a nuisance, on a long shot hope.  Most people looking for housing have gotten their situation settled by that long of a time period, even if they were in the past an interested party.

About a week later I received my move out reconciliation report and a revised copy of the apartment inspection report. The Senior Maintenance manager changed the document that I signed and his representative signed and indicated that I left the apartment dirty. No. The mentioned items were as clean as when I moved in. Also, both parties had already agreed to the items on the document. I tried to contact the Property Manager and was refused contact each time. I spoke with the maintenance manager and he informed me that what he puts on the form is final, not what the person inspecting the apartment puts. I contacted AimCo Corporate Resident Relations because changing a signed document is a no no. The next day I received a phone call from the property manager informing me that they were incorrect in changing the document and I would be receiving a check in the amount of charges they said were owed. If you have problems with this place, the best course of action is to contact AimCo Corp. When it comes to things like this, don't forget about the Fairfax County Consumer Protection Division.

However, looking at the website, I was reassured that I was moving into a nice community.Reality could not have been more different.To begin with, the air conditioning and heating units are archaic and barely work to cool even the bedrooms, much less the living/dining/kitchen area. The hallway is poorly lighted, and the army of construction workers who march through at all hours of the day is disconcerting. We constantly come home to slips of paper reporting that maintenance has repaired something in our apartment -- when we have not requested anything to be fixed, so I'm not sure what they were repairing. It took three weeks and three requests to obtain a mailbox key. Yes, a mailbox key.And that's not to mention the cockroaches who infest our kitchen. It's become an increasingly disturbing problem -- we're up to killing at least four each day now, and those are just the ones we happen to notice. The saddest thing is that management knows the building is infested but nothing has been done to alleviate the problem.The shuttle driver during our first month here was obnoxious, rude, and possibly psychotic. She yelled at riders for anything from not showing their shuttle passes long enough to not finding a seat fast enough. The only good thing I have found here is that after three weeks of complaints, she was replaced.As far as ""safety"" goes, in this ""gated community"" there certainly isn't much of it. Someone managed to steal a girl's car the second week we were here and drive it off right past the ""security guard"" at the gate.

I know that I had a hand in creating said issue, but the way I was treated by the management staff was horrendous.  It wasn't Alex or Romel that treated me unkindly, but the blonde woman that seems to be the overall boss.  I would call her out by name, but she's never even tried to introduce herself to me.  They said they sent me several emails about my car, to which I responded that I don't really check my email.  She then asked me, ""Well, how do you know when you have packages?""  Her tone insinuated that I was lying.  I only use email when I have to for taxes and other important stuff, but for the most part I honestly don't check it.  They told me that they had tried to contact me about the car multiple times, yet they didn't know who it belonged to.  I wrote down my license plate and make and model for them when I first signed the lease and the parking/storage agreement, so they knew it was my car.  They just decided that it wasn't worth looking into the paperwork to see who the car belonged to.  They then had it impounded and towed.  Like I said before, the way they handled it was ridiculous.  She made me feel like a villain in my own building.  She also pretty much called me a liar. I've been paying $140 for parking and storage since I moved in.  I've been late once, but it was only a day.  I rectified the problem immediately and with the requisite late fee.  I am a model tenant, and they treated me like some kid off the street.  We moved in here when there was only 11% occupancy and intended to stay and re-sign a lease.  We used to love it here, but now I feel very uncomfortable knowing how they treat you when you have an issue.  I feel very put down and she made me feel very insignificant when I had an issue that I was trying to discuss with them calmly.  She made it a point to blame me for the whole issue.  At the end, though, she did try to be helpful.  Since my car was impounded, we notified the apartments that we would no longer be needing a parking spot.  The parking spot was part of a parking/storage space, so, since we had cancelled our agreement, she asked if we would be needing a different storage.  I told her no, curtly, and walked away.  Why would I want to keep my things in storage, when they hauled my car away?  Maybe they'll take all my stuff, too, I don't know.  I am very dissatisfied with the way this was handled.

One time I asked someone to open my locked door on a Saturday night, and the person talking said he would, but never showed up. He also didn't pick up until 8:30AM the next day. Luckily I had a friend nearby to crash at.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0
2/14/2019,43510,5.0,My experience with Alina was absolutely amazing. Miguel in the leasing office was the best and extremely patient as I wanted to see every floor plan and every view. I had recently moved from SF to LA and needed an instant move in the manager made it extremely easy and later checked to see if I had everything I needed.,0.0,Non-Certified,32.0,0.0,1.0
5/22/2002,37398,1.0,"One word: don´t. The Woodner is an awful, smelly, roach-filled mess. The accounting staff makes errors nearly every month and apparently doesn´t concern itself with returning phone calls.  So why would someone move here at all? Cheap rent? Not after the countless accounting errors (every month). Facilities? The gym is cramped and in disrepair. Ditto for the laundry. There is an onsite store that is perfect for a steady diet of peanut butter sandwiches and stale bread (twice I purchased bread, only to discover mold growing inside -- obviously they change it often).  We regret ever giving the Woodner a chance. You should not. You deserve better than this place.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0
NOT PROVIDED,NOT PROVIDED,1.0,"[u""\r\n                                First the good--The building is beautiful and has a resort feel to it.  You will be \u201cwowed\u201d when you tour it. Joanna and Dylan are both great.  They have always provided great service and I appreciate their hard work.\n\nAll is not great at the Altis however.  A few things they won\u2019t tell you when you tour.\n\n**Move in is rough.  They have one elevator at the south end which you \u201creserve\u201d  Altho their definition of reserve is not what you would expect.  Other people will use it with you and it is very slow.  It is the only elevator on the north end so people have to walk a long distance to use another one and they will make your movers wait.  Your movers will be very unhappy.  I hear them complaining all the time.  And if you are moving yourself be prepared to be very frustrated with the elevator situation.  IMO the designer of the building wasn\u2019t thinking about move ins or they are just cheap and didn\u2019t want to put two elevators in.\n\n**Fire Alarms.  They do an annual test which consists of TWO FULL days of non stop fire alarms because they have one person go into every single unit to make sure the alarm can be heard.  If you work from home be prepared to leave for two days and don\u2019t forget about your pets.  The alarm is so loud and will be painful to your pets sensitive ears.\n\n***They are obsessed with parking.  You must register your GUESTS car.  You need the make, model and license plate.  They tell you it is easy and done through an app.  It isn\u2019t really an app, its a website, and just a pain to deal with when it is working properly, which hasn\u2019t been often recently.  IMO very unnecessary as there is plenty of parking.\n\n**Rules Rules Rules.  If you like silly rules as a result of people complaining, this is the place for you. Two of my personal favorite \u201crules\u201d  1.  You are not allowed to put a note on someone's car if they are parked in your parking space.  2.  Men are not allowed to be shirtless at any time.  This means walking from the pool to your apartment without a shirt is a no no.\n\n**Pool Hours.  I was told the pool hours are sun up to sun down by the property director Jaynee. Therefore when it gets dark at 6 it makes using the pool during the week useless for people who have a normal 9-5 job. They don't tell you that when they give you the tour.  Your rent includes use of the pool but they make the hours such that working tenants can't use.  The older retired folks will be fine tho and it seems that is really who they cater to at the Altis.\r\n                            ""]",1.0,Silver,50.0,1.0,0.0
9/21/2014,41903,2.0,"The front desk staff is helpful and the apartment itself is nice, but the building has a serious smoking problem. Management has been notified multiple times of residents violating the non-smoking rule, but they have not done anything other than send out several emails reminding residents that the building is non-smoking. The smoke comes through vents in the bathrooms and heating units. Residents in the apartments with patios have also complained numerous times about lit cigarette butts being thrown out the windows and landing on the patio. 

Another major issue with the building is the wait time for elevators. Even when both elevators are functioning, the wait time is quite long. However, one of the elevators is often out of use during high traffic times. I have personally experienced wait times over ten minutes. 

Lastly, my neighbors and I have complained about loud clanking noises made by the brand new heaters. Management has acknowledged that this is an issue across the building. I have not received any information indicating that they have fixed the issues or will be doing so.",1.0,Certified,46.0,2.0,0.0

This review is for Rizzo and Monica, they were on top of things since day one we walked in, and we couldn't be happier. 
They tried to help us anyway possible and the communication was flawless. 
We are extremely thankful and happy to have found consultants who still care so much about future residents. 
They were constantly nice, professional and helpful even after asking all kinds of question. 
Can't wait to move-in in April.
Thanks a bunch!!!",1.0,Silver,52.0,5.0,1.0
