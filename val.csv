5/26/2019,43611,1.0,"We love the location and other aspects of this Bozzuto property, but this has got to be the loudest apartment community in the history of the earth. I'm sure there are a lot of units in the complex where the noise is not an issue, but we stupidly rented above Pour House. Do not under any circumstances rent an apartment in the 124 building anywhere near Pour House. I legitimately can't believe or imagine why these units are rented, unless the tenants are hearing impaired. Drunks are outside screaming until 2-4am every single night of the week(I'm writing this @ 3am, Monday morning). We literally pray for rain, so that we can manage some sleep. We plan on submitting complaints to the police department, the city of Gaithersburg regarding the building being up to code, the attorney general, and every major website and local publication that review rental properties(yelp, , google, etc...)",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0
3/23/2006,38799,1.0,"This place is seriously awful:1)The renovations are annoying. There are random construction workers roaming the halls and using the elevators, and most of them want to talk and chat. I also hear their radios playing at 7am. 2) THE SHUTTLE BUS DRIVER IS RUDE, INAPPROPRIATE, AND I BELIEVE - A LITTLE MENTALLY UNSTABLE. She constantly talks to herself, yells at residents for any reason (kind of like the soup ----), and is just plain rude and inconsiderate. Calls to the resident relations office have gone unreturned.3) The air conditioning units are from the 1950s and must be on the highest level going at full blast to make any dent in heating the apartment now that its summertime.4) All the appliances and the decorations in the hallway are completely outdated. As someone else said, the hallways totally look like they're right out of The Shining.5) There is only one elevator working right now, and when there was a storm two days ago ALL the elevators went out of service - leaving some people stuck in the elevator, and others to walk 10 floors to their apartments if necessary.6) Spend the extra couple hundred dollars and find some place worth your money. Especially once its renovated unless the service changed, after the experience I've had, no one could even PAY me to live here any longer.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0
6/19/2004,38157,2.0,"You know what, I wanted to give Co-Op a chance. I really did.  But sorry, after getting my car side swiped twice, and the window busted and radio stolen and over $1000 of parking tickets: F*CK Co-Op.  This is the damn projects. Bottom line.  Thinking about moving here? Consider a few things first:  1. There is absolutely no parking here and there won't be any for a long time. You see, there were several garages to accomodate the 2000 residents in Co-Op, but they were all closed for renovations, due to crumbling foundation. Yeah.  That was last year, no signs of construction. And word is, the funds for construction have been depleted...spent entirely.  So just to get by, depending on the time of day, waiting time for a spot can range from 15 mins to 2, 3 hours. Seriously. Or if there's anything open you can park 7 or 8 blocks from your building. Just perfect for women when it's dark and there are crackheads and varmints lurking about.  2. ROACHES. Enough said.  3. VANDALISM: Oh, once you do find a spot somewhere on the street, pray that you don't come out to a busted window, your radio & entire console ripped out, and your car trashed on the inside. Or that some jerk hasn't side swiped your doors.  You see, the area auto glass repair people send ppl to bust windows at nite, to increase business. Take a stroll down Baychester Ave or Co-Op City Blvd, nothing but broken glass by the curb. One car was sprayed in large letters ""-------"" in bright orange spray paint. Good ole Co-Op!  4. Ticket happy police: There's no parking as I mentioned, so us residents are forced to make up parking spaces. The area police know this. Yet, they have no problem dropping $115 tickets on your car on a reg basis. Just yesterday, I was double parked for literally 30 secs. Yup, you guessed it, slammed w/ a ticket. SO much revenue from tickets and fees, yet no garages, no parking. Oh yeah, I've been towed 3 times.   5. The only positive thing is: You are convienient to 2 grocery stores, KMart, PC Richards, and a host of other stores. But oh wait, you can't afford to shop because you're broke from paying all your parking tickets. Never mind.  They also keep the lobby clean. That's it for positives.  Seriously, if you don't mind a public housing, ------ environment, and you don't have a car, maybe this is for you.  My advice: get higher standards if it is!  Good luck,  Annoyed Co-Op Tenant.  P.S. To the crackhead that posted you can't wait to move here, and that Co-Op si luxury at its finest (I literally started laughing when I read that). You need to seriously get out more, that's like saying a can of tuna fish and potato chips is fine dining. Crackhead standards.  ",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

They have moved onto building a tower building around the corner and and plan to demolish this one. There is mice, cockroaches and smells like sewage. This is what you usually find in low income apartments. The fact is these places charge $1400 and up for rent and have sub par service from the management office. They smile when you sign the lease, and if you complain later, they will make your life there miserable. I have had leaks, paint peeling off and mold issues. None of these issues get resolved by professionals, but instead by shoddy contractors who do bad work. They also have laundry rooms where the laundry machine will rip you off and the management will not refund you. That is if you can find machines that actually work.

I will admit that I was very skeptical with the lease process, as I had a less than smooth process in getting my parking space assigned.

I moved in to a brand now apartment so everything was spotless so no wear and tear. The only issue i had within the apartment was the air conditioner would leak inside of the closet but was fixed by the complex handyman very quickly. \nThe location of the apartment is tricky because it is located right next to the crosstown highway which takes you right to downtown Tampa very quickly and a newly added bar/entertainment establishment called Top Golf makes for one of the most popular places to go out in Tampa and it is walking distance so need to drive or taxi. The only issue I had with the location was road noise from the crosstown. It wasn't really noticeable during the day as is it mainly used for work commuting but at times I could hear tractor trailers and motorcycles at night which was annoying. \nOverall I was pleased the the apartment, the amenities and the staff.

12/8/2017,43077,2.0,"Maintenance staff are the best!! And recently there seems to be some new management which have been quite responsive. The front desk staff are very sweet and cordial. But there are MANY downsides. Elevators had at least one nonworking (sometimes two) almost nonstop for three months with no discount or compensation back to those totally inconvenienced by it. There is no real sense of community among residents and other than a place where people post notes in the mail room, there is no easy way to connect with folks. You have to pay $100 for a key (if you want more than one key to your own apartment). And the worst thing about living here, there are only about 20 to 25 guest spots for the whole building and there is no street parking anywhere that is readily available. So if you care about having overnight guests, it will be a struggle. The process involves greeting your guest and seeing the front desk for a paper form that you must obtain/fill out a log on paper--so they can put it in their window. (Hello, we are in the Information Age and cars park across America with apps, but apparently not at Ovation). Then even if your guest parks on his or her own they still can't get up to your apartment because that paper pass does not actually give you entry to upper floors. So your choices are to send your guest on their own and wait in the lobby for them. Or hop in their car and ride into the garage with them. TOTALLY ABSURD AND INCONVENIENT.",1.0,Gold,62.0,2.0,0.0
6/26/2016,42547,5.0,"I've lived here for just over a year. I can say that the points about the noise on 56th, the cleanliness (or lack of it) in the trash rooms), the parking garage break-ins, stolen bikes, etc. are all true. But I'm sure the same could be said of other complexes. So, I figure that's all a given. Also, the units that face the construction are cheaper than the units facing Market. It's all about location, location, location!

Other points:
- Noise: I think it takes a lot (or bionic hearing) to hear the upstairs, downstairs and side neighbors. But if it really gets bad after quiet hours, after hours security and AMLI management are quite responsive. One night I swear my downstairs neighbor was having a major party and I felt like the music would bump me out of bed. Since complaining about it to AMLI management, I've never had the issue again. 

- Resident Portal: As Crystal C had mentioned, the old portal allowed fellow residents to connect with each other. When it switched over and became a portal just to pay your rent and request maintenance, I was really sad. There was good information being posted in the old portal. I do hope Corporate brings it back. 

- Maintenance: Major props to the maintenance team. Whenever we have had an issue with something, a member of the maintenance team was quick to respond and fix our issue QUICK. 

- Package Room: Despite it being broken into, I like having it. It's really convenient to be able to get your package when you want. I used to work odd hours, so sometimes I was never able to go to the leasing office to pick up my stuff. 

- Parking Garage: I pay $135 to park my car in there (non-reserved spot). There were some issues before with lack of parking spaces, but management freed up some reserved spaces and made them non-reserved spaces. I do wish residents had the courtesy of parking their Carollas and Minis in the Compact spots, though. Spaces are tight, but what can you expect living in the city?

The renewal rate wasn't bad, but unfortunately we have to move because we just can't continue to afford living in Ballard. If you can throw down $2k for a not quite a ""real"" one-bedroom apartment (the wall in our unit doesn't touch the ceiling), then I'd totally recommend living at AMLI Mark 24. It's the first place we've lived in Seattle, and my experience has been great overall. It's a great place to live, especially if you don't have a car. Shops and entertainment are within walking distance. Even if you do need to go outside of Ballard, there are several bus lines nearby that will take you into Downtown and beyond.

-Beautiful view of Downtown Nashville.

Negatives:
-As a guest in this building, I felt as though I was always scared of being reprimanded for doing something wrong. Ex: the pool is segregated in sections for tenants and then guests. 
-Security is rude to guests. The rules are in place and there is zero room to make a ""wrong move"". Ex: resting your head for a moment on the community couch is not allowed.
-Asking for any extra soap, garbage bags, tide pods, etc. from the front desk is like pulling teeth. They said they would take care of it, but did not follow through.

HOWEVER...The neighborhood is EXTREMELY UNSAFE, being as it is right next to many S.F. housing projects. I live in one of the high rises and (1) there are always shady-looking characters waiting by the front door to sneak in when you open it; (2) vandals like to scratch up, urinate in, and set on fire the elevators as well as pull the fire alarms every day; and (3) for the extremely high rent I pay ($1700 for a tiny studio), there seem to be an awful lot of poor crackhead punks, which leads me to believe that certain types of people get huge rent discouts (and I essentially subsidize them).  I´ve had people try to open my door at night, follow my girlfriend up the elevator and back to my room, and follow me outside for blocks (as I walk to the ""------"" Safeway across the street) yelling racial slurs at me(I´m Asian). A few months ago, somebody got shot 7 times at the entrance to one of the buildings and for several days people had to walk over bloodstains and broken glass to get in. Before that, several Asian women were robbed at gunpoint in the lobby, and another Asian woman I know had her car windows bashed in while her car was parked in the *gated* and *secure* underground parking lot.  Security is awful, and the guards prefer to chill in the comfort of their office and call the S.F.P.D if things get out of hand. They´re generally best at yelling ""muthaf***er!!!"" at you if you park a U-Haul while trying to move in or out. There´s definitely racial tension in the air and a looming sense of danger.  I got a notice saying my rent would increase to $1950 unless I signed a 12 month lease (I pay $1700 now). I called anonymously and was told the same apartment rents for $1450. When I told them about the disparity, they basically told me to f*** off and move out if I didn´t like it.  Needless to say, I hate this place, and am moving as soon as possible. Going rate for studios in MUCH nicer places (e.g., Bayside Village--see reviews) is only $1450 now.  Rent at the Fillmore Center at your own risk. If you like to hear cheap boomboxes and booming car stereos at 3 in the morning, along with crackheads yelling and fighting in the street, you´ll feel right at home.

9/16/2018,43359,2.0,"When you get a tour, I wouldn't let office staff convince you that the noise from Lincoln is minimal despite the windows upstairs being double paned. The noise is so loud, every fifteen minutes you will hear sirens, and the traffic noise is very loud as well. You will never be able to use your balcony or open your windows, not only because of the noise but also, the amount of smog/traffic dirt that gets all over your balcony is disgusting. If you put any furniture out there it will get destroyed. 

Every day you will hear fire alarms going off. This happens when people are cooking, so you never know if there is an actual fire or not. 

Security is a joke. Half of the time they do not answer the phone. If you live in one of the townhouses be prepared to have to deal with homeless people sleeping on your porch, stealing your stuff, watching you thru the window, harassing you or screaming all night. 

One of the residents thought it was a smart idea to rip out the back side of one of the elevators. The elevator was out of service for about two weeks and was never fixed. The office staff never gave a notification about when it was going to be fixed or what was going on. After MANY complaints from several residents they just put some cheap wood up to ""fix"" the problem. It's been like this for months, and when we left it was still like this. Since this building is controlled access there is no direct way to get to your apartment from the garage if the elevator is broken. You'd have to park your car in the garage and walk all the way around the garage to get to another elevator on the complete other side of the building. 

The dog park needs serious maintenance. There is hardly any grass, it's all dirt. Your apartment floor will get dirty every day because you and your dog will track dirt in. There is also a bunch of deep holes in the ground from goffers, they never fixed this issue, and this is also very dangerous for your dogs (could break a leg or tear acl). Half of the residents do not pick up after their pets, so expect to walk in feces in the walk ways outside or even in the elevator if you aren't paying attention. We notified the office of this and Chris (the old manager) said they were putting out security cameras to catch residents, this never happened. 

A lot of the residents leave their dogs on the balcony even though it is against the lease agreement, and they will bark all day. The resident above us let her dogs' relief themselves on her balcony, and when she cleaned it she pushed the feces/piss off the side of the building all over our balconies and furniture. It smelled horrible, and office staff had to come clean the entire side of the building. 

The recycling shoot was broken for well over 3 months. When I contacted office staff, they said they were doing everything they could to get it working again but, in the meantime, it would help them a lot if you took it to the opposite side of the building to get rid of your recyclables (this was laughable). The pool heater was broken for a few weeks. The vending machine doesn't work half of the time. The computers are always having problems, the printer never works, or it was always out of paper. They don't do a good job keeping up with the building maintenance. 

Office staff turnover is crazy. Andrea is the new manager and if you ever need to contact her, good luck. We tried setting up an appointment with her for a walk through with Rachael, and she told me that I needed to email Andrea to set up an appointment. I emailed Andrea, waited two weeks, and I never received an email back. Eventually, I went back down to talk to Rachael, and she set up the appointment for me with Andrea. I don't know why she didn't set up the appointment to begin with. Andrea was also 30 minutes late to the appointment, so keep that in mind if you ever need anything from her regarding your move out. Also, the lobby is supposed to have a staff member at the front desk, but I think they end up quitting because half of the time there is no staff member in the office. So, if you ever need a package or need to get in touch with the staff good luck. 

I highly suggest you do the walk through with management. Do not bother cleaning or having a professional cleaner clean your apartment before moving out. You will not receive a portion of your security deposit back for the cleaning. This deposit is supposed to be refundable, but they claim they have to ""sanitize"" the apartment for the next resident. Andrea said our apartment was very clean, but she still charged us. So be aware of this, they are known for deducting unlawful things from your deposit. It's not worth it for us to take them to small claims court for a few hundred dollars, however, what they are doing is wrong.

Anyone can walk into this property since the guy at the gate only stops cars coming in. But the biggest incompetence is the management staff. They are rude, disrespectful, don't follow-up on your calls and give you attitude if you contact them about not delivering on their promises. Organization is a foreign concept for them.

We moved to Ballston and pay $300 less per month with more space. The maintenance staff were great and we loved how quiet the area was but there was always management turnover and communication issues - we called the receptionist to schedule our exit walk-through with the maintenance manager and she forgot so the day we had the walk through, we had to wait 30+ minutes for someone to show up after we called to alert them.

However management changed about three times during the 2 years I lived in Pooks Hill Towers. The first management team was great and I was sad to see them go. I don´t remember much about the second team but the third and current management team is AWFUL! I have never had to deal with such unprofessional people.  When we told them we wanted to move out they were rude. We called to reserve the service elevator the required two weeks in advance only to find out that they lost the key and no one would come to make a new one. They told us to try to find the cleaning folks and ask them...they said they weren´t allowed to give out that key. The day we moved out we had to use the regular elevators which in turn made it difficult for the other residents to use the elevators. Finally we were loading the last truck-load of belongings and we were parked in the loading dock only to be yelled at by the manager because the cleaning crew apparently needed to use the loading dock. We had to park in the front of the building. We ended up cluttering the lobby with our belongings but gratefully two residents gave us a hand and helped us carry things out to the truck.  I was notified that I would be receiving my deposit within a couple weeks. It had been about 3 weeks so I called and left a polite message asking the status of the check and to make sure they had my correct forwarding address. I received a rude response to my message saying that they processed the check the previous day but by law they can hold it for 45 days so they didn´t understand why I was calling (apparently I need to be up to date on my landlord laws). Luckily it is over and I don´t have to deal with them again.  If you enjoy rude people who don´t understand the meaning of customer service, Pooks Hill Towers is the place for you!

3/22/2014,41720,1.0,"This place is infested with roaches. This is the worst place I ever lived. I've lived in 7 different apartment complexes in various cities over the last 10 years and Capitol Park towers was by far the worst. When we viewed the apartment it seemed ok. It seemed decent for the location. I had just taken a job with a 9 month term at the department of energy, which is close by. We primarily chose the place because it was walking distance to my new job. When viewing the apartment, we saw one dead roach on the floor in the kitchen. We thought there might be something to it (i.e. a bad omen), but instead my wife and I decided to try and keep a positive outlook and assumed the place must have been vacant for a long time and one roach found its way in and died. In hind sight moving there was the worst mistake I've ever made. After being there a few weeks, we started seeing more and more and more and more roaches. I killed so many I eventually just had to accept that the entire building was infested and the only way to get rid of them all is to have everyone move out and fumigate the entire building. I set off raid bombs and sprayed everything from light weight household raid to stuff intended for outdoors that I found at Home Depot. Keep in mind this roach problem had nothing to do with our cleanliness. We took good care of the place and after the first 2 months stopped keeping any trash in the place, we would take it straight to the garbage schute. There were roaches in the cabinets and we kept finding dead ones on the dishes and silverware so we eventually stopped using the sink and kitchen altogether. The roaches took over the dishwasher and we just kept it closed indefinitely. Imagine what it's like to pay $1500 a month for a one bed room apt where you can't use the kitchen. Once, someone came by to meet us so we could all go out to an event. They brought us a cake as a gift. We accidentally sat the cake on the counter in the kitchen as we put on our shoes to go right back out the door with them to the event. In the time it took us to put on our shoes (< 5min), 3-4 roaches came out and were crawling on the container the cake was in. This place was literally like the movie ""Joe's Apartment"". My wife became so frustrated with the apartment we literally ate out for every meal. We never cooked. The roaches even managed to come out of the kitchen and into the living room. On two occasions while watching TV a roach sneaked up and crawled on me. When that kind of thing happens you simply can't be at peace in your own place. When we would walk down the hallway to the elevator there were roaches crawling on the walls and I grew to hate them so much I used to just kill them on site wherever I found them by smashing them until they disintegrated. I'm typing this from my phone, so I don't have the pictures, but I took some and they're on my computer. I will be happy to go and upload them if someone doesn't believe me. I remember after setting off 4 raid bombs, my wife went to get her hair braided from a lady she met that lived down the hall. My wife called me to bring her some food and I'll never forget seeing all those damn roaches in the other lady's apartment. Her situation was waaaaay worse than ours. She had roaches greeting you as soon as you walked in the door. I remember they were just running around all over the floor in her living room. My wife had been stepping on roaches that encroached on her space where she was sitting on the floor. Needless to say she was horrified and never went there again. Trust when I say it was the worst living experience I've ever had. One might ask why we didn't just move immediately. We thought about it and wanted to, but couldn't afford to break the lease and the time/money it takes to move. Since my job was only for a 9 month term, I wanted to just stick it out and get through it. We've now moved to Atlanta and we love the apartment complex we're in now. Once we moved we were so glad to be out of that place that we tried to block the experience out of our memories, but always vowed to one day go back and write a bad review for the place so no one else will ever choose to live there. There were other problems too, like the maintenance guy being horrible and the staff having a bad attitude etc., but the roaches were by far the worst part and made the place unlivable. The jacked up part about this whole story is what prompted me to write this review. Like I said, after we moved we tried to block the experience out of our minds and focus on the positive. However, when we moved, there was a relic that should have gotten thrown away in the move, but somehow got saved. There was a box of oatmeal that somehow the mover packed and got put in a cabinet in our new apartment. A few weeks ago we had friends over to visit and they have a young 1 yr old child. The mother asked us if we had any oatmeal she could give him. Me, not thinking just put all the oatmeal we had out on the counter for her to choose which one she wanted to use. People were talking and socializing and I was making some pancakes. 10 min later she came back to me and said, do you have any other oatmeal this one had roaches in it!!! I was so embarrassed, angry and surprised all at the same time. I couldn't believe the box from DC had made it all the way here with roaches in it. Fortunately they were dead. But I was so horrified that she almost gave it to her 1 yr old son, it prompted me to come back and write this review almost 2 years later.

Front desk concierge accepts packages up until 5:59 pm (they are eager to be out the door at 6 pm). THE BAD No noise between apartments but plenty of noise audible through the apartment doors, from the hallways, especially on weekend nights and often all night long. Building's key code entry system is a false security. If a resident gives his/her code out to someone (like pizza delivery) then anyone can get into the building at any time. Management is a bit of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Everything was fine with the rental until move out. They sent in ""The Inspector"" to my vacant unit and attempted to nickel and dime me for every little thing. Examples: cleaning the blinds and microwave (I had done these). Didn't matter. They still charged extra to clean little things that I had already done. They also attempted to charge for carpet stains (there were none) and wait for it - severely damaged floor. This was noted as pre-existing on the move-in sheet (good thing it was). There were several additional inexplicable tiny things they claimed that I had no evidence to fight. We eventually settled on a sum to be paid for the cleaning. Moral of the story: **absolutely without fail** do a walk-around with a staff member before you leave and get them to sign-off on the condition of the unit. Don't rely on their staff to do it for you because they will find fault with every little thing. Your security deposit will magically disappear as they try to charge you for the cleaning you already did, minor wear/tear for marks on the wall, stains that do not exist, etc. In fact, I would recommend doing photo and even video documentation of your unit upon move-in and upon move-out so that you yourself can prove to them (or a court of law) the condition of your unit upon move-in and move-out. Don't skip a thing, no matter how small it seems. Note ALL dents in the appliances, scratched cabinet doors, misaligned lighting fixtures, marks on walls and floors, chipped paint anywhere, and yes, be sure to empty your dryer's lint because they charged for that too (and I did empty it - they claimed they went ""deep into the exhaust duct""). Spare me please. Don't accept anything verbally because terms changed about month to month rent and what building manager told me about the cleaning. What I was told verbally suddenly didn't matter and they nickeled and dimed me and they'll do the same to you.

2/23/2017,42789,4.0,"I've lived at Ink Block the past 7 months and have had an overall positive experience.  Here's my list of pros and cons

Pros
1. Location is great to get to different points around the city.  If you work anywhere downtown, you are not a far walk.  I walk to the financial district in 20-25 minutes and I honestly never get tired of it.  You're also 1 block from the Silverline that runs up and down Washington Street and an 8 minute walk to the Orange Line.  Also, I haven't personally done this, but you can cross the bridge to South Boston and catch the Red Line. 
2. Apartments - I live in a studio in Ink 2 and love my apartment.  It's 590 sf which is large for a studio and the layout is nice where I don't see my kitchen or bathroom from my bed (this was big for me).  I hated the idea of living in a large room, but my apartment is laid out nicely where I don't always feel like I'm in the same room.  
3. Amenities - 2 gyms in the complex, amenity spaces, pool, grills, attentive concierge, leasing office staff, cleanliness!  They keep this place clean, I see a cleaning person in the halls almost everyday which is awesome.  When you're in a complex with this many people, things can get dirty and worn very fast, the management company here keeps on top of things
4. Community tenants - Whole Foods, Turnstyle, Bar Mezzana, Peets, Lion's Tail, Sweet Green.  This is fast becoming a place to hang out all day.  I sometimes don't leave the complex all weekend, there is so much to do.  

Cons
1. the obvious- price.  I pay the same for my studio as some people pay for their 2 bedrooms in Southie or the South End.  It's definitely a markup for living in a fully amenitized space.  However, I believe I rented at the peak when there was little vacancy . If you rent at the right time of year, you can probably get a ""deal.""  Rents change frequently with the market and rent rolls in the building. 
2. $350 extra for parking - again, this is steep, but with such limited resident parking in the area, I can see why people will pay this premium.  
3. Lack of green space for dogs - this is a new place and a Fast evolving neighborhood, but I wish there were more areas for my dog to run around.  There are pet areas, but they certainly aren't dog parks.  My dog refuses to go in them most of the time.  Fortunately there is Peter's Park about an 8 min walk away.  Not a huge con, and they are supposedly constructing a dog park under the expressway.
4. Some inconsiderate tenants - there is a mix of people living here, but there are certain tenants that don't bother to put their trash in the trash chute and just leave it in the trash room for someone else to take care of.  I wish they would enforce fines for these people, it really is so selfish to do this.  In fairness, I can't count how many times I've walked to the trash chute to find it malfunctioning or clogged and then having to turn around back to my apartment with my trash.  Again, not a huge deal, but if you're paying a premium for a trash chute, I wish it worked more than 50% of the time.  
5. Pool Deck Guests - this one gets to me.  During the week (when the pool is empty), the lifeguard strictly enforces the guest policy for visitors, so you can't have more than 2 guests per unit (resident?).  I had 3 one day on an empty Wednesday and wasn't allowed to hang out there.  On the weekends, it's a free for all and the pool deck is one massive party with presumably mostly visitors.  They do not enforce the sign in book and I've gone out alone just to lay out and cannot find a spot to sit, let alone lay out.  If you're not going to enforce it on the weekend, don't enforce it during the week when it's actually empty. 

Overall, I have not been bothered by noise that other tenants have complained about.  I don't really hear it and I think that my apartment faces the inside courtyard helps.",0.0,Non-Certified,16.0,0.0,1.0
6/24/2018,43275,1.0,"Updating my review as this place has been going extremely downhill. 

- noise: it is almost unbearable. Parties on weeknights and weekends that go until 4am. Drunk people leaving after a party and talking as loud as they can. Couples fighting in their apartments (one couple got into a glass throwing fight in the hallway while another couple had to have the police called on them for domestic violence at the same time). Dogs barking starting at 6am. Numerous emails have gone out asking residents to respect the noise ordinance rule, however no one listens or seems to care. My sleep has been affected and it isn't fair considering what we pay per month. We now deal with noise ourselves.  We have called Fairfax police numerous times at 2am because people were yelling on balconies and they have not shown up. The other day someone had a party on a Wednesday night. They decided to break into the pool and go for a swim at 3:30am. 

- residents: they offer low income housing. So that is bringing in some people that don't belong and are causing issues. 

- concierge: they cut back hours on concierge. Noise ordinance starts at 10pm, which is when concierge goes home. So if you need to complain about a noise you have to call the Fairfax police. They also managed to lose my package from Nordstrom, which contained a lot of important wedding items that were sold out, so I was unable to re-order. When I brought the issue up to the property manager, he suggested that I file a police report as it wasn't their problem. 

- common areas: very dirty. I think they may have gotten rid of their cleaning crew. The dog washing room is disgusting. Hair everywhere, stinky, and the washing tubs are dirty. The party room is so disrespected. Most people don't clean up after themselves and there are numerous things broken. They had to close the pool indefinitely because people broke glass and got it into the pool. 

- parking garage: people park in your spot or just park in the middle of the garage. They say they tow, but I have never seen them do it. 

- onsite gym: equipment is constantly breaking or is not put back properly. The lat pull-down cable broke and they rigged it so you can still use it, but it is just a matter of time before it breaks again. 

- elevators: there are two back elevators and one keeps breaking. It was broken for almost 3 months before it was finally repaired. This caused a huge issue for dog owners because the other elevator was reserved at least 50% of the time for people moving in. So we had to use the stairs, which have pet feces in them now due to the pets who aren't potty trained. 

- communication: the communication has slowly been getting better but it is not up to what it should be. For example, we did not get an update about the broken elevator for about a month.

AIMCO bought the building a few years ago, taking out a huge loan with the hopes of renovating it and making a profit. Three contractors later and a balcony project that took over a year to fully complete, the money for renovating is gone and corporate management is just trying to stay in the black.

2/6/2017,42772,4.0,"We have been living at Woodview since the end of April, and FINALLY, we have a breath of fresh air, compared to our previous two property management companies.

When we first moved in, the property was managed by Laramar.  They were excellent.  A few months ago, property ownership changed hands and now the property is managed by Lincoln Property Management.  I was nervous at first, how could Lincoln compare to Laramar... this has 100% been a non-issue. 

-We have never had a serious maintenance issue, and all small items that we've put through as service requests, both under old and new management, have been dealt with the same day.  (These are small items such as replacing the water filter in the fridge, replacing the oven light, fixing a leaky faucet, and fixing the shades.)

-Staff is friendly and accommodating.  I feel that they very much actually listen to our concerns.  I spent a good 20-30 minutes talking to Kristy last weekend about the building in general, and when I did bring up one issue that I saw, she listened intently and even took notes.  It is clear that the new management wants the building to be the best it can be.

-Amenities are fantastic.  A dog wash!  A dog run!  Pool & jacuzzi in the summer, plus the grills and outdoor areas are kept in fantastic shape.  We used the club room/exhibition kitchen/media room as the venue for our rehearsal dinner, and everyone was impressed.

-The units themselves are beautiful and easy to maintain/keep clean.  Neighbors are lovely and there is a great sense of community here.

The only hiccups that remain to be worked out are a fully functioning resident portal and weeding out the people who are parking in the garage without a permit (it is really annoying to pay extra for garage parking and see that the garage is very full when people without permits are parking there without consequences.)  Both of these issues I know are known to management and they are working actively to correct.

If you would like to live in a place with broken elevators, low grade appliances, and have the constant threats of fines for the complex's shortcomings hanging over your head.


The complex is a non-stop record of broken promises and absurd reactions. For some reason this is the only apartment complex in Dallas that cannot fix its own elevators. This place has been open less than a year and the central elevator has already been out for months at a time, and was deemed broken indefinitely. The secondary elevator just broke during the last round of storms and no word of when that will be fixed. During the limited time the main elevator worked, a memo was sent out saying if someone is found to have held the elevator over 20 seconds, which of course breaks it, they will be billed for the repair. So unless you like walking up or down to 8 flights of stairs every time you come and go, this is a major drawback. They also often lock the trash chute on the weekends and don't provide a dumpster, but don't leave your trash outside though; you will also be fined for that.


On your tour you will notice the friendly sounds of construction, which we were told would be from 7am to 7pm Monday-Saturday...well now construction begins at 3am and doesn't have to end until 9 pm. not joking... All residents were sent an email of this working time change and expected to accept it regardless of work schedules or apartment location. 

 Appliances are another big complaint. For ""luxury"" apartments, they have bottom of the barrel appliances and fixtures. You will most likely need to add basic essentials such as mirrors, towel racks, shelving... there isn't even lights in the bedrooms, so good luck making your ""luxury apartment"" livable. Also have fun with the smallest, noisiest dishwasher in the history of the world. 



When you leave your apartment you will get to either walk the few hundred yards to your car or down the stairs again. If it rains make sure you have your boots on. They built the parking garage completely flat and without drainage. They try and mop it, but there have been multiple instances of soaking wet shoes before or after you leave.

Long story short (or long) .... The Lofts are really really close to a being a great building but the ownership is so cheap it ruins the living experience.

Lofts - Please please please get it together... we all desperately want to love this place. Start caring about the guest experience, it is getting embarrassing and the residents will not renew if this keeps up. Fix the elevator! Get a light in the gym and a remote for the TV, don't blame residents for your shortcomings or threaten to fine them, instead apologize actively work towards a resolution. Clean the trash chutes everyday on the weekend and have them actually be available for guests to use.",1.0,Certified,47.0,2.0,0.0
9/29/2018,43372,2.0,"I lived at Circa for two years. I left when I was offered to renew the lease for my one bedroom at $2,550+/month (after utilities). I moved to a nicer building in the same neighborhood and pay $500/month less. Circa is overall a fine building but poor value proposition.

Pros:
-Folks in leasing office are very nice
-In some ways an excellent location, with proximity to restaurants and grocery stores (but see cons below)

Cons
-Sound is not isolated well. I could frequently hear, loud and clear, my neighbors arguing and babies crying down the hall. There's also a drug treatment center across the street that can get rowdy, and note that there's long-term construction across the street.
-It's a pure rental building, and built accordingly. Cheap materials throughout (vinyl rather than wood floors, scratchy carpet, very porous and stain-able countertops, etc)
-The amenities are lackluster (very small gym and pool)
-Note that no utilities are included, and you are sharing utilities with your neighbors. Some of my highest bills were when I was out of town for the entire month. Water, sewage, electricity, gas and internet are all additional.

If the price point were lower, I'd consider going back, but it would have to be significantly cheaper than their current asking prices.

Parking is definitely an issue. I live on the 3rd floor and my unit is almost right across the door you use to enter the parking garage, however, they reserved the 3rd floor for tenants living on floors 19-24 (that haven't even signed a lease yet mind you) so I have to look at the 30 empty spaces on the 3rd floor everyday, yet park in my assigned spot on the 4th floor.

The door knob to the bathroom fell off when I tried to open it. Windows were old and dirty... I don't even want to know what the electric bill would run.

When you live in an apartment complex, there are some irritating things that you simply have to live with. If you want everything to be perfect, buy your own home, or spend more on rent and live in a luxury apartment complex. For as outrageous as it costs to live in the DC area, I think it´s a bargain.

Updating my prior review based on the past several weeks of working from home with no cell signal and unreliable internet service (that we pay $160 per month for - a mandatory charge).  Myself and several others have reached out to management on several occasions, with no plan to correct this issue other than ""waiting on AT&T to come look at the boosters.""  It's been over a month.  The building's only recommendation was to enable wifi calling, which is also spotty with the poor internet signal.    

This building flooded several months back, which management now attributes a more recent loss of cell signal to (timing does not align).  If you have AT&T or Verizon, expect no service in your unit, no service in the conference rooms, and minimal service if you go all the way up to the 46th floor rooftop.  Literally impossible to work from home.  I find myself running around trying to find one bar of signal, after constantly dropping calls with clients and my executive leadership team.  I had just resigned my lease for another year, and now am needing to pay an additional $200+ per month for a WeWork membership - just to have a quiet(er) place to work with reliable cell and internet signal.  

Hoping this issue gets corrected soon.  I've talked to a dozen + other residents who are experiencing the same challenges, and have also reached out to management with no helpful reply (they say it's just in the elevators, which is 100% untrue).

I was completely surprised at how great this building was, when I stumbled in looking at apartments in the nomad area. All things considered, it's a pretty low key building tucked away off of 5th. 

I've lived in a few DM/lux buildings in the city and what sets these guys apart from the rest is the team. The staff is A+. Can't find a better group of folks to onboard you, welcome you on a daily basis and help fix any issue that comes up. They do it with a smile and that's hard to do when you're in the service industry.

The 24hr Gym is a huge plus and the rooftop BBQ grills are a huge plus. Windows are double pane and do a great job of sealing noises too.

My last point: There's no such thing as a perfect building. Things happen, fridge's leak, heat/ac units need a tweak here and there - but that happens everywhere. It's all about how the building responds to this stuff and these guys do great.

We went to the property unannounced and looked at several of the available apts. We found the leasing agent Darlene to be very helpful and friendly. I saw no evidence of urine in the elevators, out of control kids running about, or gangs in the area (I know the area is not the uppity Pac Heights or yuppie-like Marina, but we are just normal professionals who wanted a decent place to live that accepted our dog and us without putting us in the poorhouse or making us work more that one job to do it) I have to say we both love it here and intend on staying for a long long time. The location is convenient to shopping, dining, many good clubs and transportation, the apartment is really nice (we have an upper floor apartment with a fireplace and a nice view in Tower 2 for $1400 a month which is pretty good for San Francisco) We have many nice neighbors who say hello and hold the door or elevators for us, I haven´t heard any noise from any of my neighbors (with the exception of some repair work one evening which required drilling, and even that I barely heard) They even accepted our dog which was a huge selling point for me as nice apts that accept pets are tough to find in the city. I can´t speak for the parking lot issues as this is SF and we aren´t dumb enough to own a car with awesome public transportation and access to a city share car is available right here on the property. The only complaint I CAN agree with is the crummy cable they have here. The cable co. expects you to pay a fortune for only 40 channels which I think is a total ripoff. So we are surviving fine without it since the reception in our building is good for all the networks and upn, fox, WB etc (I think we get like 12 channels in all) and Blockbuster is right across the street and they have this freedom pass thing which is unlimited rentals for only $25 a month which is much less than the cable people want for those few channels!

Don't believe the reviews on rent.com, they are screened by the management so that only the good ones get posted.

PROS
Beautiful location. The apartments inside are nice, though some of the residents claim the appliances and fixtures are a little cheap. I think they are fine. Excellent maintenance staff who are very responsive and capable. They seem to be willing to help you with just about anything.

CONS
My biggest complaint is the lack of PROACTIVE management. Shortly after move-in, the common areas went downhill fast. The building exterior lights are burned out. The manager does not appear to inspect any of part of the building to ensure it's being taken care of. The pool, common areas (elevators, hallway, lobby, 3rd floor, grills, and mailboxes) are never clean even though there is what appears to competent cleaning staff.  They left the cushions on the chairs in the pool area out all winter and when it's raining - they are very dirty and I doubt they have ever been cleaned. They use this toxic nursing-home-style cleaning solution throughout the lobby that stinks so bad it makes you nauseous. Imagine breathing in toxic fumes while you are trying to run on a treadmill.

They often send out marketing (spam) emails from local businesses trying to sell you stuff; they seem to be getting kickbacks from a dog walking service, and probably other businesses, which they promote to residents.

The tiny pool is a joke given the size of the building and the number of residents who want to use it, a little more than window dressing and a way to market the building. The weather in Boston means that you can barely use it. On the days when it's actually nice, it's packed with booze hounds who act like they have never seen a pool, and have been unleashed at spring break at a frat party. Definitely not family friendly.

If you like drunks, you also get to deal with the idiots patronizing the bars next door (Whisky Priest & Atlantic Beer Garden), who seem to be obsessed with screaming their heads off all night long, especially on warmer days with nice weather. There have been a lot of complaints regarding the noise, and if you live on that side of the building, I guarantee you will notice it.

Having lived in a number of full service buildings, this one is far from ""upscale"". I was expecting a much more upscale crowd (given the high rents, which are going higher). The floors, in the common areas, once white, are now dull and yellow - perhaps due to the dog piss and the bullshit ""dog friendly"" marketing. Essentially, the building has a monopoly on anything right on the water, and they know it. They use that to their advantage to keep rents high and deliver mediocre services at best.",1.0,Certified,40.0,2.0,0.0

I was so lucky to be able to live at the Parc Meridian! I moved there after I graduated college and needed a place to live very QUICKLY. The staff was so accommodating and helpful during the application and move in process. Everyone who lived in the building was nice and friendly. I could rave forever about all the amenities. The gym was amazing and the rooftop was breathtaking. I had friends over often and having an extra space to hangout or have meetings was so convenient. In addition, the location is perfect. Being next to the metro was a lifesaver and being a walk or uber ride away from the center of Old Town is perfect for people who like to be in the center of things but not bothered by all the noise. Unfortunately, due to my career, I had to relocate to another state and couldn't renew my lease. Every apartment I've looked at since just doesn't compare. The only complaint I would make is that it is a little pricy, especially if you're recently graduated and struggling.

The building also offers a resident lounge, with two plasma TVs, a Starbucks coffee machine, and plenty of lounge space. I tend to go down there with friends from school and have study groups. The building is also manned by a 24/7 concierge/doorman, all of which are just great. They are always there to help, and have learned my name in the short time I have been there. The building offers assigned parking spaces and also free guest parking spots. 415 also offers an incredible maintenance team. These guys just do about everything for you, from changing light bulbs, to fixing appliances. All you need to do is call or log on to 415's website (yes they do have a website just for residents!) and submit a ticket and you are all set! The concierge also does some stuff behind the scenes to help you, such as signing for your packages and holding onto them for you so you don't have to worry about missing them. Every entrance in the building is protected by fobs, so only residents can get in. The staff also throws parties in the lobby for the residents, and offers some pretty cool special perks (zumba classes, discounted massages) and contests. The building is also pet friendly. When you get up to the apartments through the elevators (yes no stairs!), it gets even better. Each apartment kitchen comes fully equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, stove and an oven as well as plenty of cabinet space and a breakfast counter. The apartment also features a in unit washer and dryer, updated bathroom, computer desk, great closet space, central air/heat, a balcony, and runs on electric. 415 also has an arrangement with Comcast, where you can get great bundles for a great price, a much better price than Comcast will offer you if you go through them (415 has there own representative). When you go out of the apartment, you are in a great location. There are plenty of restaurants around, and there is a grocery store right across the street. You are also a half a block away from the Howard L stop, which gives you direct access to the Red, Yellow, and Purple line. You are also 10/15 minutes drive from Wrigleyville, Edgewater, Lakeview and Lincoln Park. As far as some of the complaints on earlier posts about the management, the simple fact is that they are gone. In fact the new management team has won some awards. It was the '2011 CAMME Award Winning Community! Best 1 & 2 Bedroom Floorplans, Best Maintenance Team, Best Common Area and Exterior Renovation!'

3/23/2017,42817,5.0,"My fiancé and I moved to the Kensington this past August. While we loved our place in Back Bay, it was time to move on after 5 years. We probably visited every dog friendly building in the area and left each building feeling frustrated, as we just weren't finding what we were looking for. Then came our visit to the Kensington. We met with Alma and Josh for the apartment tour and they were so friendly and ;s just say the rest is history. Apartment - our 1 bedroom is spacious, well-lit and very modern. We love our new home! On the rare occasion that we have needed maintenance, it was provided the same day requested. Having a quiet washer/dryer in unit is a lifesaver and it's always nice to come home with our packages delivered to our front door! Amenities - a roof deck for summer grilling, outdoor TV and a pool? This can't be beat in Boston - the hardest part is waiting for summer to be able to enjoy it again! We also enjoy heading to the 6th floor to play pool or read in the lounge. They have conference rooms you can reserve for those that do work at home too. As avid gym goers, we use the gym a lot. Have I mentioned the free classes 2x a week?!? The Kensington also offers a ton of events: farmer's market and tailor in the lobby during the week, charitable fundraisers, pool parties, Halloween to name a few! If you have a dog, you will really appreciate the grooming room and pet relief room on those rainy days. One last amenity we have enjoyed is the guest suites for out of town guests visiting - the rate is well below nearby hotels. People - simply put, the Kensington staff is awesome. They have positive attitudes every day and you can tell they really enjoy working here. They go out of their way to help you with anything you need. The building is kept immaculate by the friendliest staff - what more can you ask for? It's a great community with a lot of events offered - and you can chose to participate as much or as little as you want to. Overall, we really enjoy living at the Kensington.

9/23/2002,37522,4.0,"OK, to begin with, the other reviewers make some very solid and valid points but I seriously think that people are being overly harsh to the Fillmore Center.  I´ve lived here for 1 1/2 years now and this place is far from perfect, but certainly does not deserve the criticism is garners.  To begin with, the apartments themselves are nice. The rooms are generally spacious and comfortable. The layouts are decent and allow furniture to be setup quite livably. Most of the fixtures and appliances work very well and reliably. The building is also relatively new in comparison to a great number of San Francisco buildings.  The utilities are generally very good. Next to no power outages, cable TV ready, good water pressure and plumbing and if you use DSL, it´s close to an SBC connection center so it´s generally good and decently fast.  There are some good facilities in the buildings, including laundry rooms in each building (the higher priced rooms have their own facilities). The laundry facilities are reasonably priced, relatively new and in good working order. They run on a cashcard system (no coins) which require credit cards or a tenant application to use which serves to cut down random people who use them.  The grounds are beautiful, especially in this neighborhood (more on that later). There´s a common terrace accessable by tenants with BBQ pits, benches and picnic tables. Plus benches to sit and idle away next to man-made waterfalles and grassy spaces. There´s also a nursery school nearby and a ClubOne gym. However the gym is exorbitantly expensive ($70/mth) even after resident discounts. The gym is nicely stocked with all the regular gym equipment, a pool and classes etc. It could serve with additional upkeep for the price but it´s all servicable.  Convenience is second to none. There´s restaurants (including fast-food galore -- KFC, BK, McD´s, Popeye´s, Subway, Taco Bell), jazz clubs, Safeway, Blockbuster video, Japantown (more restaurants), movie theaters, post office, the Fillmore (even more restaurants and shops)... all within 10 minutes walk. There´s a number of buses that run right next to the complex including 38/L, 31 and 22.  In addition, the shuttle bus supplied by the Center, runs every morning, and it´s very popular gauging from the number of people who lineup to use it. Use requires a shuttle pass issued by the office.  However, saying all these good things, this place has it´s share of problems. Yes there are issues with some of the building upkeep, including :  -- The elevators (2 of them) alternate being broken every 2 weeks... and adding insult to injury, are stopped every 3 months for rountine maintainance.  -- Elevators are routinely vandalized (especially kids taking lighters to the carpet walls) and smell really bad (urine, vomit, etc). Cleaning staff however, are diligent in fixing it every morning.  -- The garbage chutes overflow and jam during the weekends when no one clears them on a daily basis.  -- The fire alarms go off every month or so, either due to pranks or false alarms.  However, in general, the complex is maintained well. In fact, the hallways are being renovated as we speak and are normally kept reasonably clean.  The neighborhood itself is a little sketchy. It IS right next to a low income area. In addition, there are low income units in the building. If this makes you uncomfortable, you need to check out the neighborhood carefully before moving in. The neighborhood is made out to be worse than it is, though. It´s no different from a great number of neighborhoods in any major city -- upper-middle class suburban living, it´s not.  Yes, there are shootings. I´ve heard one or two from my windows. It´s rumored one happened in my lobby and another in the courtyard. But usual rules apply -- it´s not any different than walking through an urban area at night. It´s not like there are people taking guns to random strangers on the street. Police Station is 2 blocks away too if you need help.  In addition, Courtesy Patrol or the rent-a-cop security force on site, is more diligent and working harder than a lot of people give them credit for. They sort out a lot of problems I have. They also have regular patrols of the buildings and grounds. They checked me out a few times when I do late night laundry or when I drive in late at night to make sure everything is legit, which makes me feel safer, in turn. When the elevators got renovated, they posted a guard in the elevator 24/7 to stem the vandals destroying the brand new walls and floors. And they posted a guy at the door when the door lock was temporarily broken. I´ve heard them questioning suspicious people entering the building late at night or people without keys entering behind other residents.  The management is a mixed bag. In general, I do think that they´re OK for normal issues. They´re not excessively helpful, but a quick visit to the office (why be so lazy ? Go in person, it´s a minute walk away) gets their attention. Requests for repair work requires a permission to enter waiver and work gets completed within a day or two -- not unreasonable.  The rent flucuates madly also due to a lack of rent control. They do get pushy if you lag in rent but once I had problems with my bank and they were nice enough to accomodate the concerns I had. Saying that, I don´t like to ask them for too much help and I don´t deal with the office all that often. I do know that when I moved in, I had the MOST helpful leasing agent -- she helped me find a unit, went against her bosses wishes to give me a preview of the apartment while it was being painted and cleaned AND helped hook me up with some person who was leaving to sell me some of his furniture cheap. However, she disappeared rather quickly, so make of it what you may.  In ending, no place is perfect. Sometimes I hate things about this place too. But overall, for the rent I´m paying in comparison to other places in the city, I´m reasonably pleased with this place. When I went apartment hunting when I first got here, I saw much, MUCH worse, for similar money. ",0.0,Non-Certified,45.0,0.0,1.0
3/10/2017,42804,1.0,"f I could give 0 stars I would. I recently moved out after living here for a year. The building itself was great but so much of what makes an apartment complex is its management. The leasing office at 2M is utterly incompetent and completely unprofessional. I have never in my life been so upset by an experience that I have actually gone online and created an account just so that I could express my dismay but my year long tenure with 2M changed that. When I moved out I was told by the leasing office that I owed a bunch of money. I told them that I would happily pay any money that I rightfully owed but that before I wrote a check I needed to know what it was that I was paying for. I feel like that is a fairly reasonable request. Paulito, who works in the leasing office started by telling me I owed money for my last month's pro-rated rent. When I showed him proof of payment he quickly changed his story saying that what I owed money for was a pet deposit that I hadn't paid. When I showed him proof of that payment I never heard back from him. A couple weeks later I got a call from a debt collector. Turns out Paulito had decided to stop communication with me and simply bring in a third party to deal with a situation that was his to deal with. Turns out that 2M had forgotten to charge me for parking for 10 months and had back-dated all the charges. They made it look as if I had neglected to pay my parking payments each month when in reality I was not being charged for parking. If the leasing office can't even keep straight which residents have parking spaces and which do not, I don't even want to begin to wonder what else is being omitted. The leasing office also gave me a lot of trouble with my dog. They were perfectly fine with her moving in with me and then suddenly, out of the blue 6 months into my lease, they were requiring me to pay out of pocket for a DNA test because she ""looked like a pit bull."" I had vet paperwork stating she wasn't but they claimed that this was not proof enough. I am sorry but if I lived in France for a year with my dog, a country where pit bulls are completely banned, and my vet paperwork was enough for her to legally get through customs and live with me over there, I think that should be more than enough proof for 2M. Regardless, I told them that I would do the DNA test provided they pay for it because they were the ones who wanted it. They never did. Long story short, I would tell anyone looking at 2M as a potential home to run for the hills and not look back. The amount of trouble and the unprofessional nature of the leasing office and its employees is not worth it at all.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

NOT PROVIDED,NOT PROVIDED,1.0,"[u""\r\n                                Harassment and threats by management. If I had given this review a few days ago, it would have been quite different from this. Yesterday we received a threatening 21/30 notice from an attorney to fix a breach of our lease agreement or be kicked out for smoking marijuana in our apartment. My boyfriend and I have lived here with our two dogs since August. We do not smoke cigarettes or use marijuana at all. Our hallway ALWAYS smells like it (that's not my problem though,) so I went to the property manager to inform her that a mistake has been made and it had to be someone else on our floor but she did not seem to care. They stated we have received multiple complaints from neighbors (which we have never been notified of) that the smell is from our apartment. She and Taneeka would not hear what I had to say nor accept even the slightest possibility this was a mistake. In fact, Taneeka insinuated that I was lying and that she checked the apartments around us and it HAD to be us. No proof.

8/12/2008,39672,3.0,"After reading all of these recent posts, I have decided that I should write about my experience at the Woodner so people can see not everyone has a horrible experience. When I first moved to DC I had 2 days to find a place to live and sign a lease and luckily I was able to get a one bedroom at the Woodner. I'm moving out now because I found a roommate and was able to find a two-bedroom for a cheaper rent. First of all, regarding the roaches. I had them when I first moved in, they sent pest control to handle it within two days. After that experience I was very vigilant, I keep all of my food in plastic containers and I clean the counters after cooking every meal. Since then I have only had one problem with roaches, and they sent someone to spray the next day. In the 12 months I have lived there they have sent people to do routine inspections of my unit three times without me asking. I think that when it comes to living in a large building in a city, there is always goign to be a bug problem, but you have to be as proactive as you can be. For example, everytime a pest control person came to my apartment (whether I called or not) I had them spray my doorway so that they could not come in from the hall (I've seen them doing that) and this has worked splendidly. Also roaches can live with out food, so you need to make sure that their water supply is cut off, for example make sure you check that your sinks aren't leaking under the cabinets. As for noise. I've lived in Lima, Madrid,Chicago, and a small college town in a unit near a bunch of greek fraternity houses. I do not find this building any noisier than any of the places I have lived. In a city you have to expect to hear emergency vehicles and other city noise. I will say that the back of the building (B-side) is a lot quieter when it comes to street noise because there is only the small street and not busy 16th street. I don't know if my experience has been completely unique or if perhaps people who have good experiences don't write in these places, but I have not had a bad time at the woodner. Security guards are always on duty and I see them walking the floors constantly (late at night) In addition to this the 24-hour laundry room is a great asset in such a building.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0
10/11/2016,42654,3.0,"This apartment complex is really nice. High end for sure. The reason I am giving such a low rating is because I recently visited Steele creek apartments which is located across the street and I think that Coda is the more expensive, wanna-be version of Steele with less to offer. There were only a few floor plans to show, each was very spacious. I will say the closet and bedroom size is much larger than Steele creek can offer. But other than that, I didn't like the layouts and lack of windows and views that these apartments had to offer. Coda had parking spaces starting at $125 a month where Steele creek was $95. Coda had a lame rooftop pool but they had to say they have a rooftop pool just like Steele. It was tiny!! They had a small deck and fire pit. It looked at buildings across the street, which isn't a view at all. Also, they have a concierge, only for competition sake, but they are only available when the leasing office is closed until midnight where Steele creek has a 24 hour concierge service. Also Coda had a very tiny gym with no yoga studio. Although they did offer classes, I can't imagine where they could have them with such a limited space. Also the gym smelled like sewer which the woman giving the tour said was due to the facility being 'new'. The kitchens were nice with great lighting and appliances. They had gas stoves which I think is nicer than Steele creeks, but it is not worth the price. They didn't have any glass floor to sealing windows in any floor plan options like Steele creek has to offer. That is a huge set back to me. They really aren't comparable to Steele because they don't have the same options. They try to, but they don't. They are also starting at higher prices than Steele creek. Steele creek has some more expensive units than Coda, like the wall to wall glass windows I mentioned, but they are more worth the price due to the full service that they offer. I felt let down when I saw Coda and they are newer apartments than Steele Creek. I would say Steele creek is the place to beat when it comes to cherry creek luxury apartments.

Cons: x The ""fitness center"" barely has any equipment and has NO fans or functioning air conditioning, making it dangerous to use during hot days. Cleaning wipes for the gym aren't regularly restocked either. x Much of the complex is filthy. Residents leave their trash on the floor of the trash chute area, with little intervention from the staff. The elevators are alternatively sticky or smell like garbage or smoke. x Spiders are everywhere. During the summer, they practically COAT the parking garage, and they come into the halls and room of the building. Also, if you don't move your car EVERYDAY, you WILL find it coated in spiders. x The parking garage entrance/exit is DANGEROUS. There is no mirror system set up for you to see cars coming from within the garage or entering the ramp from the street, so people frequently come barrelling from either side and can nearly crash into each other. Also, some of the area in the garage is only large enough for one car to fit through at a time but must handle two way traffic - which, again, is terrifying to navigate. x The front desk staff have and will detain guests staying in your apartment from coming back into the building until you come to let them back in - even if they just went to the Target right next store to grab a drink or milk for dinner. x The maintenance staff that works on the heating/cooling units - which is different from the general maintenance staff - will attempt to enter your apartment without your consent. This happened to me on various mornings while attempting to get ready and leave for the day. x Staff are not helpful and rarely responsive to tenants once the lease is signed.

My favorite things about OSM:
- The staff. They truly care. I've only needed maintenance help a few times in several years, and they were super quick to respond every time. Front office & concierge staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to make you feel welcome literally every time you walk through the lobby.
- Building quality. Concrete floors means you're not gonna hear your upstairs neighbors. Like ever. 
- Amenities. Beautiful sparkling clean common areas including the pool and hot tub. The gym has tons of legit gear. Unless you're into heavy power lifting, you've got everything you need an elevator ride away 24/7.
- Location. Simply can't be beat. You can walk to everything. I've put 10k miles on my car in 3 years. Because I can walk everywhere.

4/5/2018,43195,1.0,"An update to the update: no doubt my review touched a nerve. The immediate response from management was to bribe tenants to ""like"" on social for a $50 gift cards.

An updated review: It is a shame that residential units continue to gouge renters while offering no increase in value in return. If you ask about the price increase - especially when Seattle has trended down - and when things have gone downhill at the property, all you will get in response is a smug look and a shrug followed with ""we have to keep up with the market"".  This oft used phrase is code for ""we will continue to raise prices, arbitrarily fluctuate prices daily, even hourly, based on what we had for lunch, or how the call went with my momma; because we don't like you [insert Giant Company X & Y Employee here] and we think you can afford it"". Okay...but, wouldn't it make more sense to maintain your property and keep your residents happy? Less hassle to have 20 move ins/outs a day - although it does keep all of the off book housekeepers and maintence staff busy. Volume over value, even basic decency is the Windsor way I guess. 

A few things to watch out for; 
The noise is incredible, even high up. 
The garage is not secure. 
The dog run the the garage is chemical covered and smells.
The outdoor landscaping is a health hazard due to dropped needles, standing water, gallons of dog urine and dog poo that's not picked up. 
The concierge staff (most) is rude, is never at the desk, and can never find your packages.
You will have to go elsewhere to eat, everything is closed early evening and on weekends. 
Windsor is too cheap to host social events, unlike a few other places, equally priced. Instead, they have sporadic ""sponsored"" happy hours, and while this might be a nice addition, they aren't well planned and are last minute and tacky.
Housekeeping is hit/miss. I noticed some of the floors smell nice, others not. 
Elevators constantly need maintenance. 
Housekeeping and maintenance -with their equipment- take the residents elevators instead of the freight elevator. 
The sound isolation is poor. The insulation is poor. The window treatments are poor.

Pros:

I signed my lease before moving to Chicago and did not know that 2 of the main train crossing streets in chicago are basically adjacent to Linea.

However, this obviously comes with a lot of negatives, like security, safety, noise, and lack of green space. It advertises itself as pet-friendly (is it still??), but there are no areas for dogs to walk. You can't technically take them to the green between the mall and Vita, because it says no dogs allowed, and there's a bit of grass behind the restaurant, but there's so much poop there. Maybe that says something about the type of people who live at Vita?

When I visited, which, granted, was a while ago, security was 100% not there. I'm not talking security guards. I'm talking about key cards, secure entrances, etc. It was so bad that I heard lots of stories about random, non-residents going up to the pool area and taking advantage of amenities that they don't pay for. 

The rooftop pool is nice, and the view is amazing. However, the glass shatters really easily, so I wouldn't say it's safe..

The rooms are TINYYYYY. Especially for the price. My god. No thanks. Yes, it looks nice, but maybe for college students or those who just graduated. (who knows where they'll get the money to afford this place though)

Hallways were so starkly white. I felt like I was in an institution... with really long hallways, which were kind of narrow. 

In short: great location, tiny-ass rooms, too expensive, no security, not inviting.

9/15/2015,42262,4.0,"I'm writing this review to come to the defense of the Equity Residential team at 315 on A. I've lived there since October 2014 and have generally enjoyed the experience. We all miss the old Greystar team. They were great. Alan was an awesome concierge. I think we were all a little taken aback when Equity took over because it happened in the middle of the day with no warning. We never got to say goodbye to the old team, and that was unfortunate. 

There were definitely some bumps in the beginning for Equity. Many of them were just tonal issues with how the new people conducted their business. It definitely felt at first like they were totally lost. They blamed a lot of early issues on the building/old team, and while that may have been true, it probably wasn't the best angle to take. But you know what, running a 220 unit building is hard, and this new team was thrown into an awfully tough position. I have seen them working in the office late at night, and they do really care.

This new Equity team has for sure had a ton of complaints from me. As examples, I'm not happy that there are dogs in the building that violate stated breed restrictions. I'm also not happy that the new unit next door to me is now a corporate apartment. Not a great way to build a community. I'm also not happy that instead of addressing these complaints, they directed me to their attorneys.

All that said, 315 on A is a great place to live. The new Equity team is trying really hard. They have been very receptive to my feedback in other areas, and I applaud them for having transparent rental prices listed directly on the website. The new maintenance team is awesome, and Junior has been able to quickly fix a number of issues in our unit. The cleaning staff is incredibly friendly. The concierges in general are fantastic. They're very quick to address building issues. They've made nice changes like purchasing extra luggage carts. Overall, it's a great place to live.",1.0,Gold,64.0,4.0,1.0

There was a great deal of stress associated with this stay because of the medical situation. This is where the Harlo fell flat. Check in, after a 5hr. ride into Boston did not go well. My wife had to wait with our luggage outside the apartment door because we were given the wrong keys. It took 45 minutes to correct the situation. We could not after entry adjust the thermostat even though we followed the directions in the apartment.

Mistakes were made along the way regarding our billing and days of rental. They were corrected.

The final problem was when the Harlo had our check out date wrong. Even after I contacted the Compass ( rental agent) and corrected the mistake we returned to our apartment to find all of our belongings gone. The staff of Compass never got in touch with housekeeping .This was very upsetting. I was amazed that our apartment had been entered without our permission and all our belongings had been taken. 

The Management compensated us for our missing medical supplies, personal effects etc. however I felt they thought this was all about the money and they did not appreciate the added stress due to their failure to attend to details. There is a weak link in their system.

11/5/2015,42313,3.0,"There's a lot to like about Elan. It's new, the location is awesome, and the fact that it's made up of 3 buildings means there are a lot of amenities. The people that live there are generally really cool (including some minor celebrities and athletes). If Elan was advertised a regular apartment with your average rent rates, I'd probably give it 4 or 5 stars. However, it markets itself as ""luxury"" and charges among the highest rents you'll find in the city. Because of that, my critique is a lot more critical than an average, lower rent apartment building. First off, there were some issues with signing my lease. Elan didn't want to honor their promotion of month and half free even though I had yet to sign the lease. I won't go into details but it wasn't the best experience. 

On move-in day, despite holding my apartment 60 days in advance, there was no one there to help me fill out my papers or show me around the place as promised. After a while, I found another leasing agent that quickly helped me sign my papers but I was given no tour or anything. The move-in check I gave them was never even cashed. Once I finally got to my apartment, it was obvious they hadn't done the final cleaning they had promised. When putting away my dishes, there was drywall dust in many of my cabinets and one of my fridge doors had a crack in it. No one had lived in my unit before. 

After move-in, I haven't had too many issues but living in the west building ""Phase 2"" is sort of like being the red-headed stepchild. There's no concierge in the building unlike the other buildings. Until last week, you had to cross the street to get your packages which they luckily fixed by putting in an automated machine. Also, someone scratched their name into one of the elevator walls and it's been there for weeks. Lastly, guest parking is in the center building across the street. According to the concierge, in order for me to let someone in guest parking, I have to cross the street, take the elevator down to the parking lot, and press the button to open the garage door. Then, I have to walk them back over when they want to leave. I can't believe in 2015, that a ""luxury"" apartment wouldn't have a better way to do this. If you can buzz someone into the front door, why can't you buzz them into the garage? 

Overall, Elan isn't horrible but there are many things it could improve on. It's a nice building despite some minor fit and finish issues. Elan is worth a look if you want to move to Uptown and can afford the rates.",1.0,Silver,50.0,3.0,0.0

Though I live in the same neighborhood, my move to ViVO has not only changed my perspective, but has changed my lifestyle and my life. The difference:  High-tech appointments ... and  LIGHT! The building has loads of glass windows overlooking a wide boulevard. Secondly, the building is a PREMIER building which truly means first-class.  Every apartment has its own washer-dryer and zoned Nest heating/AC system. The elegant lobby with top-of-the-line materials and details,  the Luxer One package delivery system, and the secure key and intercom system create safety and security while being at home. 

Above the 8-floor decks -- on the roof, are Weber grills and a perfect party environment.  Below decks, in the basement, there are first-rate amenities:
a dog-washing station/room that is charming enough to wish I had a dog; a socialize room with a cozy ""fire"" and flat screen televisions in a library-styled environment; a fitness center with the latest in equipment, beautifully arranged; a yoga and spinning-cycle room separate from the weight training area; and a ""Vivo Club"" bicycle storage area with a granite-tiled open shower to clean the bikes ... plus, a bicycle repair station complete with air pump.  Most of all, the elegant access to the car parked below-ground in the attached garage allows for carefree living in the midst of snowy Boston winters, a true luxury in New England. Living at ViVO has been a very happy experience. 

The staff is top-rate and extraordinarily caring and responsive. The daily maintenance is superb ... not only for cleanliness, but also for minor repairs which keep the property looking sharp.

Then there's the neighborhood: ViVO is surrounded by contemporary steel-and-glass architecture in the cutting-edge bio-tech industry and a youthful demographic of IT workers and MIT students and faculty. There are many restaurants and cuisines to choose from in the area,  including one in the building. Kendall Square T stop is only four blocks away. In another direction, stands Kendall Square Cinema, considered to be the best cinema in the Boston area. The Charles River is nearby with opportunity for paddle-boarding or kayaking on the river. Walks and bike paths along the river, plus the Boston Esplanade on the other side of the Charles are easily accessible. MGH is one stop away on the Green Line. Conveniently located only a 10-minute walk from ViVO stands Cambridgeside Mall with loads of brand-name stores, including Best-Buy, Macy's, Sears, and a newly-redesigned Apple Store.

The counters, appliances, flooring do not look cheap like a lot of similarly priced places we looked at. The building was very well maintained and the staff was very kind and helpful. Since the building is LEED certified, our electricity was low (~$60/month). We never had trouble with noisy neighbors and I didn't hear anyone else complain about noise. Our apartment was facing the back of Starbucks, Red Mill Burgers, and a little (really good) thai restaurant so we would get woken up by garbage trucks from time to time.

4/11/2014,41740,1.0,"Okay, before our move out experience, this would have been my honest review of Riverside: Pros: 1. Good location if you don't mind living this far from DC. It's very close to the Huntington Metro. 2. The sticker price on the rent is one of the best I've found. (I'll come back to this one) 3. There's a convenience store and a dry cleaner in the second building, which I lived in. Both were very convenient to have. There's technically also a dentist office in the first building, but I never went there. 4. The people who live here are mostly quite nice and friendly. Cons: 1. Despite the low sticker price for the rent, you will be typically paying around $1400-$1500 per month including utilities, especially during the winter. The highest utilities got here was **$280**. That's absolutely ------- INSANE. The building is old and coming apart, which I'm assuming is why it's so expensive, but seriously. It almost sets off the reduced rent. 2. Management will charge you for absolutely anything. (I'll get back to this one too). 3. There's lots of parking, but if you want a reserved spot near your building it's like $50. Otherwise you have to pay $15, just to park in the lot around the complex. 4. Management is ------ and condescending, and will dismiss any complaints you have. (I will *also* come back to this one). The management office is also located way out of the way in the first building, and is a completely separate office from the much nicer central building, which is where the leasing office is. There is absolutely no reason that the Leasing Office should be separate from management. I have never ever seen this kind of personnel splitting, and it makes figuring out who to talk to over issues incredibly aggravating. 5. If you live in Tower One, you will probably quite enjoy living here. Riverside management likes to claim that Riverside is a ""luxury apartment community,"" but unless you live in the first building, that's absolute ---------. The other two buildings are absolutely falling apart, the elevators are slow and break constantly (one of them was seriously broken down for THREE ------- MONTHS before it was FINALLY fixed), and you don't get jack ---- included unless you pay extra money. The first building gets free access to the good gym in the same building as the Leasing Office - everyone else has to pay $15 per month if you want to use it. It's obvious that what happened was that the company which owns the property, Aimco, bought the complex right before the housing/property bubble burst in 2008, and had only renovated the first of three buildings before it happened, so they decided to basically screw over the people living in the other two buildings, except to put in pointless hardwood floors everywhere and a fresh coat of paint on the 30-year-old appliances. 6. As I said before, probably 30-year-old appliances. My mom lived in the area in her 20s, and she said that her old apartment had appliances pretty much exactly the same appliances still. Nuff said. Also, buy your own microwave. 7. We didn't have a pet here, but it's honestly not worth it if you do. You have to pay $500 as a deposit for either a dog or a cat, each. Then the extra pet rent runs something like $50 to $100 per month per cat, and $100 per month per dog. Also their restrictions on breeds is honestly arbitrary, but I digress. Regardless, it seems that a lot of people don't care, because a lot of people have pets here. 8. They claim the place is a ""Smoke-Free Community,"" but that's utter --------. I saw and often smelled people smoking all the time, particularly on the balcony to prevent the fire alarms from going off. 9. It used to be that if you wanted to receive a package, if it was from USPS, they would leave a note in your mailbox telling you that you had a package and to pick it up from the mailroom. UPS and FedEx often did the same. Since the winter was absolutely awful this year, Riverside management basically decided ----- IT - TAKING CARE OF PACKAGES IS HARD :("" and said that carriers had to first go to people's doors to drop off packages, and if they couldn't do that, THEN they could drop them off at the mailroom. In practice, what happened was that if they didn't leave the package at your door, you would often wonder where the hell your package was until you wandered down to the mailroom, only to realize that UPS/FedEx delivered it there without telling you. USPS just said ""screw it,"" and now if you get a package from them, you have to ACTUALLY GO TO THE POST OFFICE to pick it up, which is the biggest pain in the --- in the world if you work 9-5 during the week and thus have to go early on Saturday. There is no shuttle to go there either, and it's about a mile and a half away down Route 1, so you better have a car to go pick it up. This was probably my biggest pet peeve, and will be yours too if you ever order anything from eBay or Amazon, or have packages sent by relatives. And easily our biggest issue... 10. PESTS. EVERYWHERE. We *always* had issues with bugs getting into the apartment, especially roaches. Traps did little after two weeks, and roach spray did little either, except possibly make us ill. The place is a roach motel, and if you try to get them, they will crawl back into the walls and hide, because the building is so ancient and the workmanship on the walls so shoddy that they can just run in through the cracks in the flooring/walls. You will NEVER get rid of them - the only way to prevent them from making their home in your place is to never leave any trash around, and definitely never leave food or dirty dishes out. Ever. So in summary, before our move-out experience I would have given Riverside a 1.5 or maybe 2 stars out of five. A few nice positives, but nowhere near enough to overcome the ---------- of the negatives. Now, when we moved out, we found out that unless you give them TWO MONTHS notice, even if it's the end of your lease and you haven't renewed, they will automatically charge you TWO MONTHS EXTRA RENT PLUS ""NOTICE FEES,"" not to mention the hundreds of dollars JUST TO TURN OFF UTILITIES. And then they pile on at least $200 in cleaning costs unless you want them to fine you several hundred MORE dollars for leaving the place dirty (trust me, they'll find dirt somewhere). By the way, none of this is in the lease. At all. And their website is so ------ that you can't find any of this ANYWHERE. So in total, we had to pay around **FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS** JUST TO MOVE OUT. Basically, ---- Riverside, and ---- Aimco.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

Additionally, the building has a fantastic location. It has a combination of a quiet, suburban neighborhood behind it (great for walks, runs, and outdoor activity) and a great collection of walking distance restaurants, bars, and shopping. Not to mention, it is a 5 minute walk to the Bethesda metro station.We enjoyed many good times in Bethesda including a lot of time on the Capital Crescent Trail. Here are the only cons that I noted: - You are living with other dog owners and dogs who may or may not live up to your standard of obedience. This was not an issue for us, but you have to recognize that this is a dog friendly building - The nightlife is great for those that are 25+ but I think that 21-25 year olds (or those that are 21-25 in spirit) will end up spending a lot of time taking the metro into DC. - The gym is small. Great for sneaking in a workout but if you are a gym rat, you will still need a membership. I recommend Bethesda Sport & Health, which is walkable or a short drive.

I scheduled a late move in, so no one from the leasing office was around to tell me where to park the moving truck or how to use the freight elevators. The kind security guys helped me (one of the few bright lights of this place) and we began moving in. I noticed the smell of urine by the freight elevator. A passing resident informed me it was where the homeless person liked to pee. When I opened the door to the apartment I realized there was no way this was 700 sq ft (as promised on the phone). I later measured and it was around 390 sq ft, 430 if you include interior walls and round up. This is the exact same floor layout listed on their website as 500 sq ft, a fact I later used to convince them to move me to a larger apartment and give me a free month's rent. Also, the kitchen was literally a closet, with a 3/4 size stove and fridge, and about 1 foot of counter space. This is not an exaggeration- this place used to be a hotel and the kitchen was originally a 2 door closet. After moving to a larger apartment, I was content for about 2 months until I noticed the first cockroach. The staff were prompt in sending someone to exterminate, but due to my cats they weren't able to just bug-bomb the whole place. Four months of sealing food in plastic and washing dishes daily later and they're still an issue. The building is just old and infested. Due to the poison left out for them, I usually find dead ones now, but still, it's gross. About 5 months after living in the new apartment, I began waking up with small itchy bumps on my body. You guessed it, bedbugs. Again, this is an old building and they are an issue. In addition to the above, I noticed a minor mechanical issue after my 2nd move-in. I notified the maintenance department. The first time, there was absolutely no response. I called again, and 2 weeks later some guys came in unannounced and looked at it. They confirmed between themselves that it was an issue, and I heard nothing more. I've now contacted them a third time. It's still an issue to this day, although perhaps some of the blame on that comes from me not continually following up with them. There are some upsides to living here. Specifically, the lady who runs the dry cleaners and handles most packages is awesome, and the security guards are generally very friendly and helpful, although the key card lock on the front door is a joke (visit and you'll see what I mean). There's a convenience store downstairs, and while the prices are high, it is convenient. Finally, it's not clear from what I wrote above, but it is obvious that there are people here who are sincerely trying to improve the Woodner. But as it stands, I cannot recommend this place to anyone who can find or afford someplace else.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

7/28/2013,41483,5.0,"First, because it has been the most significant difference from ALL of my previous rental experiences, I must start with commending and praising the great individuals that work at Coppins Well. The staff at CW went above and beyond for my Husband and me during a difficult and stressful move-out/move-in situation. Not only were they fantastic for accommodating our oddball situation, but also remain so for ensuring our comfort and satisfaction to this day, whether it be the office staff, maintenance, our concierge Daunte, or even housekeeping. They have all made us feel more comfortable and welcome and generally 'taken care of' than either of us have experienced at any of our previous residences--and I've lived on my own since I was seventeen. Also: the safest, as the security here is pretty fantastic. They are all committed to maintaining the quality, elegance, safety, and beauty of this property in ways I've never seen before, which says something about the pride they all take in their work. 

Second, the common spaces that are available to us here at CW are unparalleled. The gym is on the second floor (and never bothers us). The Great Room and Coppins Room and terrace are located near our apartment and we have never experienced any 'extra noise' because of the proximity. Unless someone is very close to our door and talking loudly or laughing, I never hear neighbors (who are also very friendly). The walls are nice and insulated and help tremendously in that regard. And the roof? By far one of the most pleasant places in the entire city capable of a 360 degree view (if you get in the dog pen) of the beautiful Cascades, Olympics, Mt. Rainier, Mt. Baker, Puget Sound, Lake Union, Downtown, and beyond. Being on the 18th floor atop First Hill really makes a difference in your perspective of life in the city. It is wonderful to take a bottle of wine and enjoy the sunset by the fireplace up there. 

Our apartment is everything we need and want and is definitely the nicest space we've inhabited in the city so far. (We came from a building built in 1920.) We have a lot of wall space for my Husband's art and great big windows so we have plenty of natural light during the daytime hours. The smoke-free atmosphere, green-friendliness, and silver LEED rating also make me feel good about the choice to live here, as if all the above didn't win me over to begin with.

And all the great animals in the building? This is one of the pet-friendliest places I know of and all the awesome dogs we've 'met' since moving here have quickly made us consider adopting one of our own soon.

In short: My friends are tired of hearing me talk about how much I love our apartment and the building and how amazing everyone here is. In the words of a loved-one: ""If I didn't love you so much, I'd be a jealous hater.""",1.0,Silver,51.0,5.0,1.0

12/3/2018,43437,4.0,"So I was moving regardless of my job relocating me, too further south so I can still do my job. I find that NoVA is becoming so expensive for single people that have middle class income to have any sensible life. This does not reflect the building in no way but when they try and get closer to market value quicker than on a normal scale it hurts one's view of the apartment community. 

I moved in when it was Greystar and I guess I came in when they needed tenants so I received what is now considered far below market value rent. I would have considered living elsewhere if that was the case. I was given some items off to tempt me to live there and it worked. I lived here for close to three years and enjoyed it. Now you run in to issues like every other building but I will start out with my positives before I get to my cons. 

Nice fitness center, coffee bar/soda/granola bar at the front desk was a nice touch. I have a dog and the dog biscuits and water dish at the front was awesome. The artists feel to the building was great. Loved the artwork with the Redskin touch near the mailboxes. The warmth of the fireplace made for a welcoming every time I came in through the front door. Well priced dry cleaner right across the street, 7-Eleven and a great Chinese food around the other side of the building Fantastic. The grilling areas, which I didn't take advantage of until the end was great. I never participated in the community events minus the dog ones simply because I was not home from work yet. I feel every picture on the website is accurate and does not mislead you at all. Front desk staff may not know your name but they recognize your dog, don't blame them for that. I have a terrible time with names as well. They are accessible to hear positives or grievances as well. The building is a half mile from the Huntington Metro, three miles from 495, five miles to the start of Old Town. Not good that you are only five miles from the MGM though. Resist the best you can. If you do have a dog, you could walk through the neighborhood for a nice mile starting down hill but depending on the way back either a drastic hill or a steady hill. Dog parks are about two miles away for better ones you do have to drive to those.
My cons: Greystar did not care it seemed about aggressive dogs. My dog was attacked prior to moving there so I am very aware of those type of dogs so I avoid them at all times. People never say that their dog is aggressive until they lose control of them and they hurt others. There are a few of those that live there. No fault to Bozzuto but you should know that. Owners are lazy as hell about not picking up after their dog. They did install new bag stations at right spots but people are lazy. I once walked the building and counted close to 100 piles that people left. They sent out notices but never seemed to do anything and its hard to actually catch them in the act. We did have some thefts over this past 2018 summer when the garage door was out of service. Luckily I learned my lesson in Baltimore never to leave my bike at the bike rack but there were a few that were taken. Common area lights are an issue, especially near darker areas that are low or that are out. When my renewal rate came out I noticed some drastic new numbers that they were looking to add. Trash went up a good amount because they offer valet trash regardless if you want it or not. Yearly amenities fee now gets charged. Market value is now close to DC rent. Crazy I know. I am very observant and notice while walking my dog I count empty apartments and they seemed to increase recently which means that people simply can not afford the new price increases. I am a big believer in not punishing those who simply moved in to a new building and took advantage of those prices and chose to stay there unit price increases forced them to relocate to a new place further away from where they work.

I erroneously entered my banking information when paying my rent online on 2 separate occasions. I don't think human errors like these should be punishable. So, I emailed the district manager who said that someone would reach out regarding this issue. Jorge who reached out was not helpful at all and was by far not understanding of this mistake. Through all of this, I come to find out that you are only allowed to have 2 late payments, 2 NSFs, or 1 NSF and 1 late payment on your Camden billing account history because after this, they restrict you from being able to make a payment via your checking account (which has no convenience fee). After 2, the only other two options you have of paying your rent is by making a payment via credit card/debit card, (which has a $45 convenience fee) or paying in cash at a Walmart or cash advance type of business (which has a $2 convenience fee). After 6 months they lift this ban off you and only then will you be able to pay via your checking account. Paying a $45 convenience fee for the next 6 months? Carrying a wad of cash on you every time you need to pay your rent for the next 6 months? All this seems outlandish, inconvenient, and straight up bad customer service on Camden's part.

Also if you thought there couldn't be any more problems in this hell hole you thought wrong, they won't even turn back on the cold air in all the apartments!! I mean I understood for a while when it was really cold but to take cold air that people pay for and just make it so your only options for AC are heat or no air at all is completely absurd! We live in California and it's already getting hotter while we're still in ""winter"". AND the management is not even putting back on the cold air until winter is over! My dorm has been hotter than outside and has been 80 degrees before indoors many times because of this problem. Right now I can't even open my window and enjoy some air because someone is electrically sawing something extremely loudly. Can never get some peace and quiet here. Other than that, it seems like matinance can never get the back elevator to work in the D building, it's always opening after you press close, which is really frustrating because none of the elevators on campus do that!

Overall, I enjoyed living here and it was 4 stars experience. But towards the end, the staff made the experience to be 3 stars. And when checked out,  they made sure to make it 2 stars. 

Facility: very sharp, upscale, compact, cute small gym, nice steam room, sauna, Jacuzzi and a business center. Top floor swimming pool is great too. The apartment itself was not cozy.  It was definitely overpriced after I got to know the surrounding apartment complexes built after 2015 in Streeterville. 

Parking: $260 a month separate company (spplus). You could find a bigger spot if you have a bigger car, but it's you and your luck. 

Staff: initially, the agent who gave me the tour was the sweetest. Then she left. I had 2 major issues with the concierge and management. The concierge were rude to my guests on 2 occasions. I was embarrassed. They didn't allow one of my guests to go to the bathroom downstairs. And  persistently have rude snooty attitude. Not sure why. 
When I started living here, I was the first to occupy the apartment. The apartment was not clean. I had to clean it over 2 days period. When I exited, they charged me $180 to clean the fridge and the floor! I cleaned the sinks, the stove and the floors. Not shiny, but clean. I did not clean the fridge because simply I forgot. When I told them, I received a phony brushing off response. If you charge someone $3300/month, it's so cheap of them to overcharge for cleaning tiny things. 

My suggestion for improvement:

I wouldn't recommend you come here unless they change the attitude. It's overpriced. The staff are stuck up and not professional here. If they address these concerns, change the management to a professional one, I think it'll make a better place..",1.0,Silver,55.0,1.0,0.0

They had some issues with one of the garage doors in the winter, and the rather sudden shift in location for the 16th st shuttle stop, but really tried to communicate fully with residents on what was going on and their attempts to find solutions.  Also appreciated was their effort to move social events away from alcohol-centric things and provide a broader range of options.

7/15/2018,43296,4.0,"My husband & I have lived here for a little over 2.5 years and have mostly really enjoyed it. I think there are some helpful things to know if you're deciding to live here:

Pros:
- The modern style of the apartment is really nice. The kitchen in our unit has a lot of storage, which is great if you like to cook! Big windows let in a lot of light.
- Laundry in unit, which can be hard to find in Boston
- The people who work at the front desk/office/or maintenance are WONDERFUL - really great people who are so friendly and helpful.
- It's awesome to have a concierge to hold packages.
- garage parking in the building (not free obviously) is awesome especially in the winter 
- Some nice amenities, including a pool (I only go on weekdays, though - in weekends, the pool is unbearably crowded - see below).
- Living above Whole Foods? As AMAZING as it sounds! And there are some other great places in the building, too: Capital One/Peet's Coffee, Fuji (sushi), Sweetgreens, etc.
- Overall, the neighborhood is great and accessible to a lot. You're a quick walk to SOWA, tons of parks, Chinatown, etc. If you work in the Financial District you can walk to work in 20 minutes. The Tufts Medical Center Orange Line T stop is less than a 10 minute walk. Tremont Street in the South End is less than a 10 minute walk.

Cons:
- This is not a quiet place to live (which is the primary reason we're relocating; we have a young child and he is constantly woken up by the noise). On two sides of the building you have highways right below and on two sides are major construction projects that are really loud. Add in the fact that there are several young tenants who party (see below) and many people have dogs here that regularly bark and it can be quite loud. (We got a new neighbor a few weeks ago and their large dog barks at all hours of the night). There's also random other noise, like inexplicably loud hammering at 3am. You can always report this to the concierge but there's often little they can do unless they can find the source (though, again, they're wonderful!)
- Understandably, but worth noting, rent is not cheap here. It's market rent (see below) so depending on the unit and when you move in and the length of your lease, your rent will vary.

Good to know:
- The crowd here seems to lean young, or at least seems to party young. For example: in the summer, the pool is overrun by people and their guests (while you're only supposed to have 2 guests, it doesn't seem enforced), and largely feels like a frat party. Similarly, I've seen tenants who party in the hallways (e.g., I saw a group that was drunkenly hoverboarding down the hallway while screaming and laughing for hours) or who generally don't take care of the place (e.g., just leaving piles of garbage in the room w/ the trash chute).  Mostly, this hasn't bothered us other than the noise. But I think it's good to know :)
- I think if you don't understand or don't want to live in a place with market rent, the seemingly random nature of how rent is determined can be frustrating. I.e., it's not going to be like you can really negotiate w/ the people who work in the office downstairs, as the rent is set by a national company. My husband and I decided to change units at the end of our first lease because there was an identical apartment available for a lot less. We know 5 other tenants here and 4 of them moved to a different unit at some point in their living here to get cheaper rent. That could be a pro or a con, depending on what's available/if you're okay moving halfway through living here/if you'd rather pay a possible increase in rent just to stay in your apartment. It didn't bother us! :)",1.0,Gold,61.0,4.0,1.0

I feel this is a common situation, at least based on my experience with other similar type of apartments. If you ask questions by email, you will have to wait for a long while until they get back to you, and they automatically skip/ignore the questions they don't want to answer. 

Venn has a lot of hidden fee as well. You have to pay $20 registration fees for a system in order to receive your package. You will be forced to sign up for it. 

Update: it has been a few months now since living here. My personal water bill is only $7, but since we have to pay for the common area electricity and sewer the bill ended up to be $90+.... note that this does not include your own electricity. 

One day I woke up realizing the owner of Venn sold the entire apartment building to Equity Apartments. The new management team made some unpleasant changes. For example, they removed the nice coffee machine we used to have in the common area. They also shorten the office hour so now I have to wait until 12pm on Sunday in order to talk to them and fix issues.

3/19/2016,42448,1.0,"For the rent you pay, you think they would have made things a lot nicer.  They cut a lot of corners during construction and you won't really notice until you move in.  But, once you do notice, you won't be able to ignore it.  The walls/floors are thin.  I can hear my upstairs neighbor walking all the time and I can hear full on conversations that my neighbors are having as I walk by their doors.  The carpet in the bedroom is cheap and hideous.  The tile in the bathroom is also cheap and impossible to clean.   The pass that they give you to swipe to get into your apartment and around the building rarely ever works on the first attempt.  The door to the Whole Foods (the one that they will proudly tell you gives you direct access to the store so you don't have to go outside in the cold) only works about 50% of the time.

Management is very slow to respond, if they respond at all, to complaints.  I had an issue and the property manager promised me a lot of solutions (one of which was letting me out of my lease).  She was supposed to call me back, but never did.  On top of that, when I requested to speak with her several more times, she never got back to me.  I eventually just gave up.  

The only thing pet friendly about this place is the fact that they will allow your pet to live there for a ridiculously large pet fee.  Your pet is not allowed anywhere except your apartment and inconveniently located dog parks.  The real issue with the dog park is that the two parks that do exist are very isolated.  It does not feel safe to take my dog out there at night.  Moreover, in the original lease that I signed, it clearly states that there was supposed to be an area to take my dog to the bathroom in the Ink 2 building.  No such area exists.  They finally put something in the garage, but you have to walk your pet through garage traffic to get to the room.  Moreover, the room is simply a cement floor with a drain in it!!

3/15/2018,43174,1.0,"I wish there were words to describe how awful this apartment building is in EVERY aspect. Staff: Initially there was a good management staff that had nice maintenance people but now a new company has taken over and EVERY SINGLE MONTH there is an issue. Every month they change the payment type they'll accept. To use their online payment portal you have to pay a $86 credit card fee so we switched to personal check the next month they said they won't accept that. The new management company has made no attempt to introduce themselves and they make everything a hassle when it comes to dealing with payments. They'll give you charges without explanation. They recently started saying that all residents had to park behind the gated area and a great amount of the parking spots behind the gated area are reserved, for who? I don't know. Building: The elevators are so slow you can end up waiting and waiting to get on them. They had parcel lockers installed so that you wouldn't have to pick up your packages during office hours, great idea? You would think but they installed them behind two sets of locked doors so no deliveries can be made after office hours anyway. I ran into a delivery person who called this building ""the hardest to access in uptown"". The pets of residents poop and pee in the hallways and management has done nothing about it. Cost: Probably about the same as the rest of uptown BUT you pay ALL utilities. Water, sewage, trash, electric. They REQUIRE a $25 valet trash subscription. It's ridiculous. Apartment: It's a nice apartment but you can tell where they cut corners. There is no light in the living room. You have to install your own main lighting in the living room. You can tell they were going to do it but decided to save money because there is a hole for it and light switches. When I asked about it they said ""you can install your own"". Many of the things are clearly from liquidation places such as the countertops as there are flaws in it. It was painted hastily as the paint on the cupboards. The shower had grout where it shouldn't be. The closets are great but poorly designed given that the shelves and hangers are too high to be practical. The door to the apartment is warped.

2/17/2017,42783,5.0,"The good: the building is beautiful, and I loved it when I first moved in. My apartment looks lovely, the residents are great (mostly friendly young professionals + many dogs :)), the people who work here are nice, and everything is kept immaculately clean. I have yet to find a bug in my apartment! I chose the building for its location: my top priority was being close to a park by the water where I could walk my beloved old dog, and this was the best I found. The amenities are awesome, I especially love the gym; it is the nicest I've ever seen in a building, and has a lot of equipment you usually only find in high-end gyms. The courtyard is also lovely, though I wish dogs were allowed, at least on the paved areas (I understand why they would not want dogs using it as a bathroom, it is too small a space for too many dogs and would likely start looking gross pretty quickly). 
The bad: I am confident that there *are* apartments in the building that i would love, but I do not like my own. The building was designed such that you potentially have to walk 3 VERY VERY LONG hallways to get out. This might be fine for the able-bodied, but my dog has severe arthritis and can barely walk some days. It takes us 8 min just to reach the elevator, and by the time we get out, she no longer has the leg energy to make it to the park 2 blocks away. I am not sure about the building insulation: I've seen other reviews praising the building for being quiet, but I hear a tremendous amount of noise from my upstairs neighbor in the middle of the night. But again, I've not heard this complaint from others, so I think it may be just my particular neighbor. 
The good, again: I contacted management a couple weeks ago to ask if it might be possible to transfer apartments mid-lease. I just got a very helpful response, and it looks like I""ll soon be able to move much closer to the elevator. So, I am again a happy tenant, and intend to stay in this building.",1.0,Silver,51.0,5.0,1.0

TJ is constantly hosting fun events in order to get residents to mingle and has always been very professional and kind when I have questions or concerns. Maintenance is always accommodating, responsive, and professional. I have made suggestions to management in the past about accessibility and safety, and they have always listened and implemented my ideas! Free coffee and tea are offered every morning in the community kitchen. The workshop space allows me to create and build without worrying about messing up my actual apartment. The fifth-floor eco-roof is full of rosemary, lavender, eucalyptus, and many other beautiful plants. Cons: A class system quite literally exists within the building. There are amenities that floors 6-21 cannot access, and residents throw shade if you hit the elevator button for floors 6-8. There are some unfriendly and unaccommodating front desk employees. The gym within the building is very expensive ($60 for a day pass). Parking around the building is a little sketchy. The actual garage is too expensive for me, and street parking has gotten better with break-ins.

7/2/2013,41457,1.0,"So I have had a different opinion of this apartment. Since I moved in on day 1, I have had many issues, most of which have not been resolved or will never be resolved. The biggest problem is the noise at this apartment. It is directly over the El and while the daily noise of it cruising by is not the issue, they work on it almost every night. Because this apartment is within the loop, construction and everything else is allowed to go on at all hours of the night. Because of this, they work daily on the train and surrounding areas from 9:00 PM until roughly 5:00 AM. Also, trash pickup is allowed at all hours of the night so just imagine a person outside your window crashing pots and pans together several times throughout the night. Because there are 5 different companies that have dumpsters behind the complex, expect it several times a night. If you do not like to sleep, this place is ideal for you. If they lie to you, like they did to me when I moved in, they will tell you it is really quiet. I cannot hear neighbors ever, but I swear to you that the outside noise can be heard from every apartment in the building. I went back and forth with ----- (manager) on the trash pickup for quite some time and in the end, he basically said tough luck. Since Waste Management is our waste company, I at least hoped he could get them to pick up at a normal time, but he said the owners of the building are too cheap to switch providers to one that will respect peoples sleep schedule. Maintenance is also relatively poor. Since February when I moved in, my dryer has not worked and maintenance refuses to try to dry a load of laundry to verify that it does not work. They turn it on, it heats up and they are good with it. Unfortunately it takes three times to dry a load of laundry. I have asked repeatedly, literally like 10 times, and nothing is done about it. I have given up on it at this point. My ceiling also leaked during the intense rain and it took almost 4 weeks to fix. As a consequence, the people fixing my roof let water sit on the floor and the cheap flooring peeled up. I asked for this to be fixed as well, and it never happened. Finally, section 8 housing. While I am not saying that everyone that lives there on section 8 is bad, I personally have a hard time paying what I do while others get to live there at half the cost. I realize these individuals are just as hard working as anyone, but I am just letting everyone know that this place has section 8 housing. The apartment complex in general has potential, but in no way can it be a 5 star rated property. Walk through the hallways and see how dirty the carpets are and how bad the hallways smell before you decide on this place. Also, please realize that you will have noise issues no matter what apartment you are in. This place is a strong no. Much quieter and nicer places outside the loop.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

Seriously, you need to protect yourself and take photos of everything when you move in...also look at the carpet VERY closely.

I was charged about $500, and lost my security deposit, because of 5 ""stains"" on the carpet which I swear where already there when I moved in...I just thought they were so small it was no big deal. One was a cigarette burn, and since I don't smoke, it would be impossible for me to cause! I tried to contest the whole thing, and they basically said 'Too Bad' and sent my case to a collection agency. I had to pay it because it was blocking me from renting a new apartment in my new state.

This building has terrible sound proofing. I could literally hear my neighbor snoring through the wall at night. I heard my other neighbor sneeze and it sounded like it came from the other room of my apartment. My upstairs neighbor's alarm went off every morning at 5am and it was like my own alarm was going off. Walking down the halls you can hear conversations in each unit you pass as if you're in the room with them. It is actually creepy to know people can hear into your own home so easily.

8/24/2016,42606,1.0,"I would go elsewhere - literally anywhere else with your money. I have lived in ""luxury"" apartments in Chicago, and other cities, for some time. I have never had as many issues with management and staff than while at Coast at Lakeshore East. Our rent for one bedroom neared 3k (rents are raised substantially with each subsequent lease, and even more so if you sign on for less than 12-18 months for whatever reason), and I suppose we were paying for the view? However, as a resident of Marina City a year before Coast, I can assure you, that you will be paying half elsewhere with a view, and for a much more responsive and polite management team. Just a few examples: 1) Lock yourself out? Pay 50 dollars to have a maintenance person open your door. I have to believe that's the going rate for a minute of labor in this particular building, as that is also what they'll charge you for leaving outstanding trash in the hallway (let's say, for example, it doesn't fit into the tiny hallway shute, or immediately surrounding area). Oh, or you can go down 30 something floors with your boxes to the basement where the apparently belong. NOTE: Most ""luxury"" apartments in the loop and River North include these costs within rent. I have always had box cleanup and lockout in past apartments without any issues. This isn't losing a key or a FOB either -- your doors automatically lock so if you go to the trash chute, gym, or a neighbors and realize you don't have your key...$50 if its not M-F 9-5. The real kicker here is that you can fill out Permission to Enter for your housekeeper, friends, dogwalkers, etc. and maintenance lets them in at any time. So you yourself cannot get into your apartment for free, but you can call someone with permission to enter and they can be let in. We once paid our housekeeper 25 dollars to come down town and have maintenance let us in our own apartment instead of paying the 50 dollars for them to simply let us in....seriously 2) Maintenance. Our washer broke and took several days to fix/replace. Of course we weren't reimbursed for the laundry we had to send out in that time frame. Oh, but they did give us another unit to do our laundry in, if we wanted to. Not exactly ""luxurious"" carrying around my laundry in a basket like a college freshman. Let's back up, when it broke - we smelled gas. We immediately called the front desk, only to be told it's ""nothing"" after a brief investigation. A week later when maintenance responded to our request they scolded us for not notifying anyone of the gas leak. Sigh. Scolding was a constant with a few members of the engineering staff. You also cannot replace your own light bulbs but also must pay them to do it. This is on top of the fact that everything in the apartment, from the walls, to the floor, to fixtures are as cheap as can be. I admit they look nice, but when living there it is very clear that they spent the absolute minimum and only cared about appearance NOTE: For reference, I recently had an appliance break in my current luxury condo, and it was replaced while I was at work, without any questions asked - and they even fixed other things while there, that we didn't ask about. 3) Elevators. They are horrible. Bottom line, I had to plan for the worst each morning, which at times could exceed 5 minutes. 4) SPIDERS. Look, this likely isn't the fault of management (unless there is some method of eradicating them) but it is the most pervasive issue with the building. During the spring, summer, and fall months there were spiderwebs throughout every balcony (at least facing north, the best view) and anywhere from 5-20 large spiders on the balcony at any time. We had several bottles of spider repellent and killing spray, as well as brooms to destroy webs and it never made much of a difference. So much for that view. No amount of extermination can facilitate a lengthy balcony stand/sit without being bothered by large spiders. 5) Another non-management issue: any delivery, uber, lyft, postmate, or friend following GPS will almost certainly get lost. Something is wrong with the GPS coordinates and it takes them to lower wacker or lower lower wacker. I am sure someone with some pull could get this fixed but if not, be prepared to wait exorbitant amounts of time for any food delivery or uber pickup and to have more than your fair share of confusing and irritating calls trying to lead drivers to the door. 

On a positive note: Door staff/package room are nice as are the people who work them. The package room is overwhelmed with boxes due to the proliferation of amazon prime and the like but the staff is kind, courteous, and always attempting to do well. 

Bottom line - If I was paying closer to $1,2000/month I'd be happy with The Coast. If you are going to pay what they're asking, I'd just look around a little more. The supposed amenities are nowhere near the price you pay for them and similar/better views and apartments can be found throughout downtown for less money.",1.0,Silver,51.0,1.0,0.0

Though I tried to make my apartment feel as a home as much as I could, and always keep it clean, it was so disgusting to live there. I never felt at home in my own apartment; it was just a place I slept in and watched movies in. There were always tons of small roaches as soon as you'd walk in to the place. Hallway dark, smelly and depressing. I have no idean how I got it, but I had bed bugs that bit me on several parts of my body. The bed bugs became such a problem that I could actually even see them crawl around. Once my friend slept over and she was bit too, I never told her I knew what the problem depended on, it was too embarrassing! Police is always there because there is always some ---- going on. Two people were murdered while I lived there. The men did not know how to act civilized around a good-looking and well-dressed woman. They would always hit on everyone. And once when I wasin the laundru room, this guy made sexual comments about me, and I got so pissed. I went to the security and reported him ...

As another review states below, we were promised when we moved in last fall that the construction would not affect us. This could not have been more false. I will spare you the details of all scenarios no longer relevant to new residents. Now onto the things you will unfortunately experience: The elevators are constantly having issues (if they even have all four running - which is rare). The fire alarm has gone off in the middle of the night 3 times. Each time, an email has gone out the next morning saying, in a nutshell, ""don't worry - there wasn't a fire"" with tips on how to better manage excess smoke when cooking i.e. open up a window or open your dryer, which has a vent. That literally was a suggestion.

This brings me to another frustration - there are constant emails to residents regarding building updates, trivia nights, changes in schedules, pet rule reminders, new package retrieval systems etc. I want to have a peaceful living environment when I get home from work, one that doesn't email me constantly regarding issues and changes throughout the building. They clearly don't have it together or processes would be in place that are efficient and effective i.e. only email residents with pets (you have a list!) in regard to leash reminders.

The AVA is advertised as a new apartment building with great amenities. One of the amenities being the rooftop, which is constantly full of college students partying. So much so that they recently implemented a rule on maximum guests per resident (another email!) that are allowed on the rooftop at any given time. The gym is great. However, I've been in there twice when they brought a tour of 10+ people, likely investors, through. Where was that email?! Or how about a simple sign that states a walk through will take place at X time so I don't have to feel uncomfortable when a group of men in suits walks through the gym in the middle of my workout...

12/18/2015,42356,2.0,"I'm hopeful that others jump in with more reviews - maybe my experience was an anomaly.

170 Amsterdam is a very distinctive-looking new building.  Some people love the architecture, a lot of the neighbors don't.  I think it looks cool, and they manage to take some of that design into the building, in the common areas and the apartments.  Even the bathroom floors reflect the aesthetic.  It was all designed very cleverly, and the whole package hangs together and looks great.

But here's where we run into some problems - the execution is just not up to the design.  These are very expensive apartments, especially since they're a little small.  It's disappointing that finishes and appliances are very much mid-range, although new.  The windows are great and big, but the roller shades are ineffective at keeping out light, and are way too translucent to provide enough privacy.  And probably the biggest issue - the one that forced me to move after 6 weeks - was the noise that comes through the walls.  They're relatively thin in the first place, but the building also hasn't solved some engineering challenges related to the gap where the interior wall meets the glass exterior, and allows conversation and TV noise to just pass through from apartment to apartment relatively unabated.  Hopefully they should be able to figure that out - I just wasn't willing to wait for it.  In addition, my apartment was on the North end of the building, and I had a constant rumble from the next door synagogue's HVAC that I couldn't stop hearing.

Service was inconsistent, also.  The doormen are friendly, professional and otherwise great, although they've surprisingly got a lot of administrative work to do and are trapped behind a wall, so they can't provide a ton of assistance for residents coming in the door with packages or luggage.  The porters and service department were perfectly nice, but my (brand new) apartment was not well inspected and fairly scuffed up when I moved in, and although I was promised that they'd touch-up, it never really happened.  It took several weeks to remedy a minor construction defect that took probably about an hour to correct.  Pretty much every deadline they provided about anything - from the beginning of the leasing process, to maintenance commitments, to the very last signature - was blown through without any acknowledgement.  I think a lot of that had to do with the building's manager, who was not ready for the job, not customer-focused, and I believe no longer at the building.  All that said, now in a new Equity building, I think I'm continuing to see a minor disconnect between management and maintenance, so this might be a corporate issue that 170 just needs some time to navigate.

I appreciated Equity's policies that allowed me to transfer to another building of theirs, and the process - guided by the rental staff at the Trumps - was surprisingly painless.  Like I said above, I'm hopeful that others jump in with their reviews - I got a lemon of an apartment, and didn't have a good vibe with management, but maybe that's a minority experience.",1.0,Certified,43.0,2.0,0.0

2/17/2009,39861,2.0,"I have lived at Falkland Chase for about two years and CAN'T WAIT to leave. I've had a number of problems with my apartment. I have been locked in/out several times of my own bedrooms due to crappy doorknobs. Appliances in the kitchen are old. Had to replace my fridge, because it no longer got cold. They first came and defrosted it, then about two weeks later there was no progress so they had to replace it. Now these are all minor problems. Maintenance is very nice and very helpful, usually respond to resquests within 48 hrs, unless very urgent. Now, here are the things that made my time at Falkland Chase unbearable (but of course had to deal) MICE! there are mice all over this community. I have had maintenance come more than 5 times about mice. No matter how clean I keep the kitchen, those suckers find a way in. There are holes in the side of the building in which the mice come through, and I've even seen them just walk right in from the front door. While putting the garbage out, I see dead mice all over the pavement and it's not very pleasant. Other thing, the laundry rooms. They are not in each building which means you have to trek your way over there with your laundry. And when its cold out, it's no fun going in and out just to do laundry, but of course it has to be done. The walls are paper thin, you can hear everything your neighbor does, which isnt very pleasant. Their stomping sometimes causes my whole apartment to shake.

Nice try, Hope. Change the building's Yelp page from ""Centerra"" to ""Centerra by Alliance"" just before Alliance Residential is booted as the property management company then use this as an excuse to create a new Yelp page.

Not uncreative, actually. But your miscalculation was that all of the tenants you pissed off (and stole security deposits from) wouldn't discover this and re-post reviews about their horrible experiences on your new page.

My wife and I were two of the most loyal residents in the building when we moved out at the end of August (we moved in when less than 25% of the units were occupied and construction was still being done on the upper floors of the building). There was a lot to like about the building initially - solid management team, smaller number of respectful residents, and a clean property. By the time we left, though, the good management team was gone and the building was overrun with obnoxiously young professionals who would pee/smoke in the elevators and scream in the hallways at all hours of the night. Oh, and the elevators - always broken. In fact, for the first time in our lives, my wife and I each got stuck in Centerra elevators on separate occasions (the elevators were also broken on both our move-in and move-out days). 

But the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back for us was Hope withholding our entire security deposit. Same exact scenario as other reviewers. She claimed the apartment that we had cleaned by a professional 3-person crew just before dropping off our keys on move-out day needed to be re-cleaned. And that the spotless carpets had to be steam-cleaned. One of Hope's minions actually had the audacity to tell me that the unit was not clean to Centerra's standards. Sorry to break it to them, but the legal standard in CA isn't Centerra's mysterious standards, it's the unit being ""as clean as it was when the tenant moved in."" 

When I emailed Hope to ask for the receipts CA law requires landlords to furnish to former tenants for work done...crickets. Not a word back. 

Since multiple reviewers here have reported being shafted out of their security deposits in the same way as us, I'm thinking that Hope believed that because this deposit was a fraction of the monthly rent, no one would really care. Take $500 here. $600 there. $700 over there. But as with the Yelp page name change, this was a miscalculation. And when you add in the late penalty fees and punitive damages that Centerra will be on the hook for in small claims court - not to mention negative reviews from formerly loyal tenants - it may get costly for them.",0.0,Non-Certified,26.0,0.0,0.0

My furnace/air conditioner broke and after they fixed it it would on random occasions blow the smell of gasoline all through the apartment until I turned it off. I called to have them look at this 4 times and eventually they just had the attitude of, 'we can't find the problem so deal with it.' I was forced to turn my heat down to 50 at night and when I wasn't home due to feeling it was unsafe leaving it unattended.

Also, I do not know WHAT people are talking about when they say the building is not soundproof- I have never heard a peep out of my neighbors!   

My only complaints are with some minor details about the apartment, and the system that they have set up for retrieving packages.  There are no lights in the closets, which make it pretty difficult to see things and I am not a huge fan of the wire shelves that were installed as they are difficult to put clothes onto.  There is also no overhead lighting in the bedroom, and in the bathroom the only lights are on the mirror which makes showering a little dark.  I also dislike the electric stoves.

The maintenance staff is excellent, however they are so over busy because Bozzuto did a crap job of constructing the place. It was constructed with cheap materials that don't last over time and are of poor quality. Part of the side of our walls just started falling off one day. If you look at the siding of the halls you can see how the ground and walls are uneven and don't touch in all places. The appliances are horrible and will need replaced or just don't work even though they are new (low quality), the construction is poor and needs extra upkeep.

3/17/2003,37697,3.0,"The Fillmore Center is not a bad area to live in ONLY if you get an apartment in M1, M2, T1. Don’t get an apartment between Ellis and Turk Streets. As they say, it’s all about location and a few blocks make a big difference. The neighborhood is not that bad…depending on which street you live on. So again, don’t live from Ellis Street down.  My apartment is pretty decent: new fixtures, newly painted, and the carpet is clean. But the noise level is a problem. The next-door neighbors blast their music and have parties at all hours of the night. The security has warned them a few times so I think they may have gotten the picture. By law, you are not supposed to be able to hear your neighbor’s “unusual activities” after 10:00 p.m. At that point, the police can actually be called for that. I haven’t had to call the police though since the security seems to have it under control.  The staff at the Fillmore Center (security, engineering and maintenance) are friendly and helpful. The leasing office is another story. Once you’ve moved in, you will rarely get return call s from them…even the customer service manager doesn’t return calls. They also don’t seem to know what’s going on and seem uninformed. There is high turnover there, which adds to their ignorance about the complex.  The FREE shuttle to the financial district is very helpful – it’s always on time and usually you can get a seat. The only problem is if you work in SOMA, the closest stop is Union Square…quite a walk if you work in that area.  If you’re facing Fillmore, Turk or Ellis streets, you will hear a lot of traffic noise from police and ambulance sirens, traffic, and boom cars. These cars are the worst. They all blast their music (especially on sunny days) and their music shakes all of your windows. The windows do not do a good job of keeping out noise so the noise penetrates into your apartment. There is a market on the corner of Turk and Fillmore that seems to attract many of these boom cars. The cars stop in front of the market for what seems to be 5 minutes BLARING their music. It must be either a mating call or some sort of drug deal signal…I’m not sure but it’s REALLY disturbing. If you get an apartment, try to get it in M1, M2, or T1!! These apartments are quieter from the outside noise.  Overall, I would recommend the Fillmore Center…again, remember the three apartment buildings to live in…and you will be fine. It’s convenient, clean and the rents are pretty decent compared to other apartments in the area. Make sure you get a move in special (one month free, etc.) when you sign your lease. They are always offering special discounts. Oh and the parking situation…they have garages that you pay for $170 per month but the problem is, many people do not pay and park for free until they get found out. So if you’re paying $170 a month, you are probably making up for all of the other people who are not paying!! So if you can, try to negotiate the parking rate too when you sign the lease.

This property (501 and 601 Holland Lane) used to be managed by Post Properties Inc., but around December 2016, it was acquired by Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (MAA).  Keep this time-frame in mind when reading the other reviews. 

Since MAA took over, the quality of property management has tremendously declined, meanwhile, they have jacked up the rent prices dramatically and inexplicably.  

Post Properties when it ran Post Caryle Square was able to provide high-quality services at reasonable rent prices.  Then MAA took over.  It looks like this new company (MAA) is only interested in maximizing profits, and cutting costs.  

No longer worth it.

The following are recent reviews of other (former) Post properties, which MAA took over.  Sadly, the trend is apparent:

Post Briarcliff:  ""The quality of the community has declined considerably since MAA took over the management of Post Briarcliff. Many tenants are moving out because it is no longer what it used to be; it's not worth living here anymore. There are communities nearby where you get more for your money.""

Post Lakeside: ""I have lived at Post Lakeside now for 3.5 years. If I were writing this review a year ago, I would have absolutely given Post Lakeside 5 stars.

We did choose this unit specifically for its strategic location to the dog run area and for the size of the patio when we pre-leased this unit in January 2017 :) In the summer time, we've grown a lot of plants from (smaller) peach tree, to lemon, jasmine flower, rose, kale, tomatoes and a bunch of herbs such as cilantro, parsley, lavender, oregano, etc. Yes, we just love our apartment! Really enjoy the open floor plan! Can you believe that we were able to fit our 10-seater acacia wood dining table in our dining room?  We had 2 of those, one we placed in the patio for the summer outdoor gatherings! 

Staff: The best. Concierge team cares about you and gets to know you. They'll take care of whatever you need. (Thanks, Nate, for knowing whether its my book club time and/or my workout time (or any other event) with the girls for my women's group).  Maintenance staff: fast and efficient. Honestly don't know all of their names since you don't interact with them much nor see them if you need something fixed but when you do see them, they're very friendly! Leasing staff: all very nice and approachable! LeAnna and her whole team deserves an applause!

Again, it's not a perfect building and it certainly has had many issues the past 1.5+ years, however, they've done their best job to resolve many of the issues. Advise to new residents: if something is broken and/or you need help, seek help by telling someone, maybe concierge and/or leasing officer, and guaranteed, someone will try their best to resolve your issues. And really, let's all be kind in this world, and show your gratitude/appreciation by letting them know the positives as well. 

Thank you, Tower12! You're the best!

Summary-
They basically operate like a scam, that is - Before they have you money or lease, they'll behave like the best deal you can get. But once you sign a lease with them, you're are actually signing up for problems until 2-3 months after your lease date. Only positive things about this place are it's location and one of the people on their staff (Jennifer). 

Detailed review:
1. Break-ins at their 'secure-garage' are more frequent than Trump's tweets. Someone stole my car's license plates while it was parked there.
2. At least at 4-5 different occasions within the one month, someone set up file/arson in their hallways forcing the residents to evacuate in the middle of night. And they still don't have any clue about the perp. 
3. At least at 2 different instances, one of the members of their staff entered into my apartment without any notice, without my permission and without knocking. 
4. Upon ending my lease, I left my the apartment in pristine condition. During the move-out inspection, I kept on wondering that why was the apartment manager in so much hurry even when I had a full 30 minute appointment for inspecting a 1 Br/Ba. He never signed the move-out inspection form and told me that I will get that in email. So after a week, I get an email that walls have damage and will need to be repainted, apartment was dirty etc and that I owe 600$. Moreover, in the final receipt they had added some parking charges too which I had cancelled 3 weeks before moving out. Upon asking for corrected receipt multiple times, the apartment managers didn't respond. Instead, after a month I got a notice that my account will be sent to collections if I don't pay. That's arrogance at it's peak. 
When I insisted my legal rights and facts, they sent me a 'corrected receipt', which still had incorrect charges. And guess what, I was back billed for utilities for upto 3-4 months before moving out, with the back bill charges overhead being more than the actual bill.
5. Adding more to reflect the greed of the apartment managers - The rent increase on my new lease offer was 300$ more each month, and that too during the holiday season. Finally they couldn't get any tenant until 4 months after I had vacated and had to finally let go the apartment at 100$ cheaper per month than what I was paying. I was willing to bring them new qualified tenant who was ready to sign the new lease and move-in 20 days before my lease end. But they declined to allow that and ended up losing that tenant. 
So, if you want a place where you can get some peace of mind and not worry about stupid things while residing that or after moving out.. I would highly recommend looking somewhere else!!",1.0,Silver,53.0,1.0,0.0

2/1/2019,43497,1.0,"If I could give this apartment building a zero, I would. 

The good: location, maintenance complaints are quickly addressed, friendly front desk staff.

The bad: 1. Terrible security. Anyone can get in the building and get to any unit. The call box is a joke (I swear it's only there for show).  There have been multiple thefts in the garage including tires being stolen yet management does nothing to make this property more secure. Even police have made comments that better security measures are needed. 

2. Hallways on 3rd floor (and perhaps others) isn't adequately heated.

3.  This complex is so pet friendly that they allow animal bodily functions to remain on floors.

4.  Poorly constructed. Walls are really thin.

5.  Fire alarm has gone off several times in the middle of the night and management does not have the decency to even email their residents to let them know what is going on and why their sleep was disturbed at 3am!

6.  Management is useless!!! They don't care about their residents (only collecting the monthly rent). The response from management to any complaint you bring to their attention is, ""We'll look into it,"" or ""We're working on it.""  They've even said to me (regarding improving security), ""We looked into the matter but additional security for the elevators is too expensive.""  They say they want to discuss ways to improve your overall living experience at Highgate at the Mile but it's total patronizing bulls***. They just want to appear caring online and in public but it's fake. They have no sense of decency to their residents to even send an email anytime a crime occurs on their property.  For example, tires were stolen from one of the resident's car that was parked in the building's garage. Police and management were notified this morning but there has been nothing from management alerting the residents about this incident.

7.  Rent is not cheap and yet these people cut corners in the construction of this building and they do not care to make improvements in anything.

This place brags about offering such amazing amenities and luxurious living to its residents but it's just not worth the money. KETTLER Management has poor reviews on Google which is completely deserving seeing the way they manage this property.",1.0,Silver,52.0,1.0,0.0

The woman in the leasing office did not have any one with her but took awhile to acknowledge us. It was now May and we did not want to move in until mid August. She called us into her office and did not even stand up to bring us in. We stood there awkwardly at her desk without being offered a seat she asked when we wanted to move in. I told her August and she immediately went into a long rant explaining why they don't have August availability just yet because of their 60 day notice policy. Little does she know I fully understand this policy. Her rant was so long I literally had to interrrupt her and tell her we were leaving. In the end, we decided to lease at one of her newer competitors.

We were new to Wisconsin and had less than a week for all - to find a place, to go back to another state to get our stuff and to move here.

Despite having an excellent rental history and having lived in luxury buildings in DC and NYC, we were denied and told we would need to apply with a guarantor. This seemed outrageous to us as we've never encountered an issue like this before. Begrudgingly, we asked one of our parents (with impeccable credit) to co-sign with us. We were denied again and told the only way to move in was with a $5,000 deposit. Excuse me? 

This ordeal took a week and now the building will not return our $300 reservation fee. We have no apartment, we're out $300 and we had to ask a relative to co-sign with us for nothing!

8/25/2017,42972,3.0,"This review is based on the quality of the facilities, the value for the price, and the onsite staff. I've been living here since spring 2016 and wanted to wait until it was time to renew my lease before writing a comprehensive review. 

GOOD:
When this place first opened, it was under Kettler, which did a horrible job managing the place. For several months, communication was minimal, the place was unsafe, and the facility was not properly maintained. Bozzuto has definitely improved communication, quality, and safety of VITA. The place has rotating security on the Plaza and Lobby levels which help keep non-residents from causing trouble. The common areas are kept clean everyday, and on a regular basis, the each of the floor hallways are vacuumed. I really love the smell of the cleaning agent. It's like an avocado base which fills the lobby air. Very refreshing. So good that I found a hair cleanser that has the same fragrance. Definitely a perk!

The concierge and leasing staff have always been friendly. I personally enjoy interactions with each of them. The concierge is 24/7 and helps with deliveries. Having that delivery and dry cleaning service is one less worry. Coming home to a smiling face to greet you makes VITA really feel like home. I enjoy them being there. I only wish the leasing office had longer hours since I work most of the day and only have a small window to meet them, except on the weekend.

Being upstairs to Tyson's Corner Center has been amazing! I never had to worry about dinner. Being a right-turn from the beltway has been convenient to go places. And being a safe walk to the metro has made it easier to get into DC. Also having secured parking makes me feel at ease during a stormy day and my car safe from theft.

The price has been on par with other residential places in the area. In fact it may be slightly less expensive. I was only looking into 1 bedrooms however. Definitely a viable option in Tysons given the location and quality.

BAD:
When you look closely at the finish, the contractors cut corners. The front door doesn't have a floor mesh to prevent slamming. It's awfully loud when someone lets the door close by itself. You can hear it loud and clear from your room. It has woken me up late at night many times. Some of the corners of the walls were quickly assembled leaving unpolished edges. A few bolts and screws where inserted slightly diagonal. One or two light bulbs were not connected. Cracks in some of the floor tiles. These are some of the small details. When I imagine luxury living, I envision OCD-SteveJobsStyle-perfectionism to the quality of the handiwork. The industrial design of the building tried to be different, but I wish they applied a gloss or coat instead of the unpolished finish on the building outside. I'm glad I don't have a corner room where it converges into a very acute angle of 15 degress. That corner space is pretty much unlivable.

The elevators are often slow. During non-peak hours it will take 2-3 minutes. During peak hours 5-630p, it can take up to 10 minutes. Part of it could be a poor logic controller design, the other part just not enough elevators for the amount of traffic. They also smell musty. Some air circulation or freshener would definitely help. One of the things that bug me is that two of the elevators top out at floor 29, but the rooftop clubhouse is on 30. So if you are unlucky you either have to try for the other 3 elevators (75% chance) or walk up a flight a stairs. I'm okay with that but, some other residents may not have the same mobility.
 
One of the most unsettling things however is the bargaining posture when it came down to renewal rates. I was over quoted and expected to bargain to achieve a fair rate. This isn't the first time I've experienced these policies, and frankly it's quite irritating. Being forced to consider moving whenever it's time for renewal is not something that adds to one's quality of life at VITA (and ironically VITA means ""life"" in Italian). While a business' first priority is to itself, these practices of maximizing profits over customer experience are becoming more evident in a late stage capital market. Please reconsider your renewal practices and provide residents a better experience. While everything else has been awesome, one poor experience will influence the overall perception because of negative bias. An easy, no hassle renewal will make it easier for current and prospective customers, and just as importantly, your staff so they can provide an honest and intentional service that their residents will definitely value and appreciate.

The leasing staff is extremely professional, accommodating, and well-trained to handle a variety of situations and the maintenance staff is even better. 

As I am wrapping up my one-year lease, some cons to living here:
- Elevators can run extremely slow at peak hours, and there really should be another elevator for the amount of residents there are (especially if one is locked off for someone to move in/out or it's out of service)
- Hoards of children running around the lobby and outside courtyard (sometimes unsupervised) which makes the building pretty noisy at all hours 
- Walls in between apartments are pretty thin. I can hear microwaves in other apartments going off, and my neighbors in #717 frequently have a screaming child crying even late into the night when you want peace and quiet
- Gym temperature is incredibly inconsistent and polar extremes day-to-day :( Sometimes it's a sauna and sometimes it feels like the Artic/neither are ideal

Some pros:
- Plenty of common area space to utilize on the ground floor as well as the rooftops (huge fan of the grills on the rooftop!)
- Resident events throughout the year
- Coffee machine (I never used this but it's a plus for those who like to have it) as well as water bottle refill stations

Just the facts....

- Elevators frequently are out of service, repair time is 1+ weeks. Manager tells you he is waiting on parts.  One time the door safety switch was not working and the elevator stayed in service.  Shocking.
- Ice Machine out of service for extended period of time (1 year +)
- Printers never work, when you ask about it manager tells you he can't get them fixed. Annoying.
- The amenities fee is charged even though the amenities are minimal.
- Property is no longer cleaned regularly, halls, floors, windows, yuk.
- MAA does not perform scheduled maintenance on items like apartment HVAC filters. If you want your filter serviced you have to request it. (door is locked) We figured ours needed service after two years and serious allergies. Yuk.
- MAA does not perform preventative maintenance on smoke detectors, you have to replace the battery yourself. Post used to change batteries for you. This is no big deal - except if you need a ladder at 3 AM.
- Residents smoke pot on the rooftops.  
- MAA does not have regular concierge on duty making it difficult to get packages.  The manager says he is trying to hire someone but can't. In the mean time residents cannot get packages in a timely manner. Forget about perishables like flowers, unless you know they are coming you wont find out till they are dead.  They store them in the back room.
-Dogs pee daily at inside the building (side door), it is disgusting coming home from work and walking in pee. We call it the pee chute.

7/15/2018,43296,4.0,"My husband & I have lived here for a little over 2.5 years and have mostly really enjoyed it. I think there are some helpful things to know if you're deciding to live here:

Pros:
- The modern style of the apartment is really nice. The kitchen in our unit has a lot of storage, which is great if you like to cook! Big windows let in a lot of light.
- Laundry in unit, which can be hard to find in Boston
- The people who work at the front desk/office/or maintenance are WONDERFUL - really great people who are so friendly and helpful.
- It's awesome to have a concierge to hold packages.
- garage parking in the building (not free obviously) is awesome especially in the winter 
- Some nice amenities, including a pool (I only go on weekdays, though - in weekends, the pool is unbearably crowded - see below).
- Living above Whole Foods? As AMAZING as it sounds! And there are some other great places in the building, too: Capital One/Peet's Coffee, Fuji (sushi), Sweetgreens, etc.
- Overall, the neighborhood is great and accessible to a lot. You're a quick walk to SOWA, tons of parks, Chinatown, etc. If you work in the Financial District you can walk to work in 20 minutes. The Tufts Medical Center Orange Line T stop is less than a 10 minute walk. Tremont Street in the South End is less than a 10 minute walk.

Cons:
- This is not a quiet place to live (which is the primary reason we're relocating; we have a young child and he is constantly woken up by the noise). On two sides of the building you have highways right below and on two sides are major construction projects that are really loud. Add in the fact that there are several young tenants who party (see below) and many people have dogs here that regularly bark and it can be quite loud. (We got a new neighbor a few weeks ago and their large dog barks at all hours of the night). There's also random other noise, like inexplicably loud hammering at 3am. You can always report this to the concierge but there's often little they can do unless they can find the source (though, again, they're wonderful!)
- Understandably, but worth noting, rent is not cheap here. It's market rent (see below) so depending on the unit and when you move in and the length of your lease, your rent will vary.

Good to know:
- The crowd here seems to lean young, or at least seems to party young. For example: in the summer, the pool is overrun by people and their guests (while you're only supposed to have 2 guests, it doesn't seem enforced), and largely feels like a frat party. Similarly, I've seen tenants who party in the hallways (e.g., I saw a group that was drunkenly hoverboarding down the hallway while screaming and laughing for hours) or who generally don't take care of the place (e.g., just leaving piles of garbage in the room w/ the trash chute).  Mostly, this hasn't bothered us other than the noise. But I think it's good to know :)
- I think if you don't understand or don't want to live in a place with market rent, the seemingly random nature of how rent is determined can be frustrating. I.e., it's not going to be like you can really negotiate w/ the people who work in the office downstairs, as the rent is set by a national company. My husband and I decided to change units at the end of our first lease because there was an identical apartment available for a lot less. We know 5 other tenants here and 4 of them moved to a different unit at some point in their living here to get cheaper rent. That could be a pro or a con, depending on what's available/if you're okay moving halfway through living here/if you'd rather pay a possible increase in rent just to stay in your apartment.

1/5/2019,43470,1.0,"Hey guys, it is with a huge weight on my heart that for the first time in my life, I have to use public means to complaint about something, but this time Fillmore Center deserves it. I've been living here for almost two years and noticed multiple issues since moving in, but considering my higher than average threshold for complaints, I've always decided to move on (i.e., elevator is always broken, laundry machines very often don't work etc.); however, now they exceeded any threshold: My bike was stolen from the bike rack that they make available to residents on building T3. The most annoying part is that a couple of months ago my wife's bike tire had been stolen from the same place and, despite our complaint to the service patrol team, nothing has changed regarding security. Obviously, we did not solely rely upon the property management to do something about it, and added additional locks to both bikes, which still wasn't enough: someone had the access, knowledge and time to break three solid locks (including one chain) to steel my bike. It is very frustrating because the property management was warned when my wife's bike tire was stolen and nothing happened; as well as I'm assuming nothing will happen again, despite my financial loss (the bike wasn't a cheap one). While they say bikes are not their responsibility, I can't see how security is not. Another issue that is worth noting is the terrible package system that they have. Just in the past couple of months I lost three packages, that Amazon and UPS said were delivered, but they never found them. In one of the cases, the property management specifically said that it was never delivered, just to tell me one month later that they had the package in the back (after I had requested a reimbursement and re-ordered the item). The worse was still about to come: I received a code from the system used by the property manager with the picture of the package being delivered by UPS, but when I went there to pick it up, the code did not work and they said that ""UPS must have not completed the delivery"". Fillmore Center, it is unacceptable that these things are happening. These are all security-related issues that should not be happening, especially considering the extremely high rent charged to the residents. I wish I was hopeful that something would happen regarding these issues, but at this point I know it is not; thus the complaint. At this point, I'm waiting until my lease is up to move on with my life away from the Fillmore Center. Recommend you do the same. Bruno, 01/05/2019",0.0,Non-Certified,45.0,0.0,0.0

The water from the shower is too powerful; it actually hurts after awhile, and the only way to turn it down is to use cold water only. Kitchens were very small; not a lot of counter space. And water was constantly being shut off. The shuttle bus driver CAN'T DRIVE. He keeps going over bumps and talks to people for several minutes before moving the bus. Be prepared to wait longer than 20 minutes for the shuttle.

I should've walked away when the incompentent employee did not have a clue what she was doing in processing my application. I am active duty military and have an 804 credit score, yet they wanted past mortgage statements, pay stubs, DNA, grandparents birth certificate, etc.. (ok, a slight exaggeration, but it was painful). I did get a 5% discount for being military, but was forced to pay all of that back when I moved out 2 months before my lease ended. Here's where things got sketchy,,, I moved out early and paid all of the penalties, including a full months rent extra, then I got a larger Apt, since my family had just moved up from NC. Riverside (assuming I had left the state) decided to conduct the move-out inspection without notifying me. The head maintenance guy (Jimmie) did the inspection all by himself. He found 5 stains (the size of a dime or smaller) on the carpet and a small strip of lamination that had lifted behind the kitchen sink. The sink was like that when I moved in 10 months earlier and I did not stain the carpet. I had it professionally steam cleaned and it was spotless. So, Jimmie charged me $250 for the carpet and another $250 for the counter. I have been contesting the charges for a couple of months now. So Riverside came up with an authentic looking invoice for the carpet cleaning fees. I called the number on the invoice for TBK Cleaners at 703-930-8390. Some guy named Bob answered, but he wouldn't confirm that had an official business and would not give a business address. I asked if he know Jimmie from Riverside and he said yes, they are friends.

The elevators often do not work, leaving residents stuck between floors or having to walk up and down the 8 flights to thier units. There are two HUGE law suits pending now in DC Court, one in which the tenants who were renting at the time of the sale of the building are suing to challenge the legality of the sale itself, the other in which a seperate group of tenants are suing on the grounds that the management has failed to provide them with safe and adquate housing as required by their leases.

3/25/2019,43549,2.0,"Really want to give this place 3 stars (or more) but it's become such as huge pain I can't justify anything higher than a 2.  I've been going to the mall at UTC since the late 80's maybe early 90's.  Suffice it to say... a long time and previously, this was a great mall.  Great shops, mostly outdoor and very open which is so nice given our weather and parking was fairly abundant and other than the winter holidays, not much of a problem.  

But 2015 changed all of that.  The mall starts a major renovation which originally was advertised as being finished by 2017.  What a joke and for whomever is going to contest this... they DID have signs saying ""completion 2017"".  Well, here we are 2019 and they still aren't done.  Albeit, probably about 75-80% completed but not finished.  And while I'm sure the mall won't take responsibility for the city building the trolley line, I'm sure the mall had input.  

Okay, like everyone else... the parking!  Charging for parking!!!  I get it... with all the new condos going up around the mall, you don't want people parking in the garage who aren't shopping.  And with the trolley coming, you don't want it to become a ""park & ride"" place.  Okay, I get it.  But with only the gym and theater providing validation for parking beyond 2 hours... I'm probably going to frequent other places for my shopping.  And these days, there is very little you cannot buy online and have delivered to your home so the big shopping centers need to be careful about things turning their customers away.  For example, I go to the mall today to use the gym.  I was at the gym for an hour but when I tried to leave, the machine said ""this ticket has already been used to exit"".  How in the world could that be?  The ticket's been in my car the entire time. I had to back up, go to the ""parking office"" and when I tried to explain it to the people who worked in that office, the first response I got was ""did you put the ticket in the machine?""  I swear it's so frustrating dealing with people who don't even listen.  I explained it once again and the guy asked me if I had been in the mall more than 2 hours!  The card is date and time stamped I told him!  Clearly if he had looked at the card he could have seen I had barely been in the parking garage an hour.  Furthermore, supposedly there is a picture of your license plate taken when you enter so why can't you look at that to verify how long I've been here.  And finally.... I can't believe I had to go through all that hassle!!!!  

The mall is getting a bit pretentious and again, I will emphasize... there is VERY LITTLE you can't buy online these days.  Amazon even has a ""try before you buy"" where you can get clothes delivered and you have a week to try them before you are charged.  Don't like them... just return in the prepaid return packaging.  So, when I think about the hassles of going to this mall and weigh that against the convenience of ordering something online and having it delivered to my front door... I just can't think of many reasons to really want to go to this mall.  The gym?  There are other 24 Hour fitness locations.  

Ultimately, I do feel it comes down to the parking situation.  You need to have all stores validate and especially the restaurants.  What if we go to a movie and decide to have a nice meal afterwards?  Or, while we are waiting for the movie, we go shopping, then see the movie and have dinner after?  There are many situations where people are going to go over the 2 hour limit and there is nothing so unique about this mall that I need to waste money on parking.  

I'll probably keep going for the gym only... but the next time I get a message from the parking machine telling me the ticket I have is no longer valid... will the LAST time I EVER go to this mall.",0.0,Non-Certified,42.0,0.0,0.0

Which I might add, you can definitely feel that vibe in the way they property cuts corners but charges premium rent rates as if its some fine living establishment. The cleanliness of the property is dodgy at best. There is always dog feces matted into the concrete on my way to the BBQ grills (yes the bbq grills are an upside) or there is constant construction going on around the property. Security is nice but I think they have one guard or two that walks the entire property, so if you're looking for safety, keep looking. Overall, this is a terrible place to live and I will not be renewing my lease. Save yourself the hassle.

We are almost in the projects (well in the middle of 3 housing projects) and I don't appreciate being woken up at 4am but junkies, alcoholics and inconsiderate people yelling and screaming!Our pizza guy was mugged when he trying to deliver our pizza and now they won't delive to our neighborhood anymore!

We pay so much but I feel that we are barely tolerated by the staff here. I don't feel like they do all that much for me. I have lived at other places and the staff there were great. The staff here fail miserably in comparison. Its so hard for you to break your lease... nobody can afford to pay 2 months rent to leave! We live in a nicer part of the center but after all that's happened lately, people getting held up, people get shot outside the Foot Locker and down on Buchanan... no thank you! And when we moved in, we had to install DSL because it wasn't cable ready. But I had problems with that since my DSL connection was even slower than dial up. And the DSL people told me it was most likely because of the wiring in the apartment! Before you move in here, please try to find other places that are probably safer and cheaper!

The good reviews about this dump of a place are made by former or current employees who want to shower you with their lies and take your money. Everyone I know who lives here or has resided here in the past has hated it and has ran into problems.

When I first moved in the apartment was not in move in condition, the kitchen dishwasher was filled with black sewage like water. The kitchen sinks were filthy. The bathroom cabinets were not installed. Furniture was damaged/missing! Security also allows random people without key fobs into the building instead of letting them out. This is especially bad during the weekends when people who do NOT live here attend parties and end up trashing the elevators and hallways with empty beer cans and stink the whole place up with the smell of weed. All they do is sit there behind the counter and go on their phones watching videos, they couldn't give a rat's ass about your safety!

People at the reception desk always give you the runaround answers saying they'll check on your issues and update you but then do nothing. Whoever sorts the packages needs to go back to school and learn to read because packages almost always get mislabeled and will most likely be lost. They dont check for ID when picking up packages so a lot of packages  are stolen/lost! They write a wrong apartment number on there and give YOUR package to a random person and then act clueless when you inquire about your lost package. This will happen frequently so you'd best be better off getting a P.O. box at a separate location. 

This apartment building also states that it does NOT allow pets but dogs are rampant here. You'll see at least one dog on any given day lounging about on the pool deck.

Alas, I found droppings in my meticulously clean apartment yesterday. There are eight clothes dryers in the laundry room, seven of which operate (amounting to less than one dryer per floor of occupants). Decent size apartment and balcony, but the tiny kitchen is never less than eighty degrees F (better than ideal for insect populations); just wait until you start cooking for the temp to soar. The cheapest possible paint is sprayed on most surfaces; the enamel-painted cupboard surfaces adhere paint to plates and cookware.

They allowed my roommate to sub-lease her room to 2 roommates instead of 1, which left me living with 2 people I did not know who also had multiple pets. The management company was completely negligent to respond to multiple issues I came into contact with while living there. They gave me a temporary parking pass and told me I could park in the lot and then had my car towed, they charged me double my rent one month and then said ""oh well I guess you just won't have to pay next month then!"", told me I would get August free as part of a promotion they were having, and then charged me for August and said they ""didn't remember making that promise at the time of my lease""as well as the biggest issue which was letting two people rent a room intended for one person. My living environment was not only uncomfortable but also unbearable because of the way my new ""roommates"" lived. This property management company also gets new management multiple times a year but it never helps because everyone that works their is lazy, incompetent, and unresponsive. This is a legitimate scam of a complex that is money thirsty and out to get students who most likely do not know their rights as renters. I would never recommend Courtside/ Skybox to a friend, not even my worst enemy. To top it all off, somehow the manager is always ""on the phone"" or ""in a meeting"" EVERY SINGLE TIME you have a problem, need help with something, or have a complaint. Convenient.

Do not live here, I read reviews on Yelp before signing my lease but assumed people were being dramatic but trust me when I say there are not even words to describe how awful my living experience was there.

Update (in response to Courtside's reply)
This is actually comical. Maybe try responding when I was a resident with a list of complaints that NEEDED to be resolved. You've been completely negligent. Do not try and act like you communicate and resolve issues simply because this is a public platform.

Things seem to have stabilized now and the new management team , led by Sid, are doing a great job! The staff are very friendly and helpful. They are putting on events for residents all the time, which are fun and a great way to meet your neighbors. Yesterday they sponsored a Super Bowl party that filled two of the rooftop venues. Sid and team provided burgers and other great eats and the residents all pitched in and brought potluck. It was a blast. 

One of the things we love most is the building is very pet friendly.  We lost our best buddy recently and have have been missing him something fierce. Since getting to know our neighbors at the sponsored events, we have loved spending time with some wonderful dogs
(There's even a rooftop dog walk, complete with fire hydrant)

It is like living in a 5 star hotel as far as we are concerned. Concierge services, terrific gym and movie theater and a fabulous rooftop with sky lounges, gourmet kitchen, game room and the most spectacular view in all Seattle. 

The residents run the gamut from tons of Millenials to a contingent of Baby Boomers like us. The rents are very steep, but we were willing to give it a try just to have the ""urban experience"". Surrounded by shopping and restaurants everywhere you turn has been a real experience for us. Being located just two blocks above Pike Place Market, we are in the thick of things and can walk everywhere. The Westlake Light Rail and transportation center is only two blocks away. I travel constantly and being able to walk three minutes and then ride straight to SEATAC for $3 is huge for me, especially with no traffic to deal with!!

There's building is built as solid as an absolute fortress. We never hear our neighbors, except for the rare party being held on our floor. All the noise is coming off the street. You are dead center in downtown Seattle and you just have to accept the street noise comes with the territory. Sometimes some of the parties up on the rooftop venues can get a little boisterous and carried away (a bunch of 20 somethings living the life). Not a big deal usually and it seems the problem tends to be the guests, not the residents most of the time. We like that the building is non-smoking throughout, at least the building management does their best to enforce it. 

There are only a few things we don't care for. The access is to the secure garage is off the narrow and dark alley behind the building and the construction of a building across the alley has made for a traffic hassle. That should be completed soon and the problem cleared up. 

This entire downtown  area is full of the homeless and drug addicts, which means you need to be alert when you're out on the street and in the alley. The Seattle mayor's office seems to be unwilling, or too politically correct and  ""hands-off"" to deal with the problem. The Viktoria recently hired a nighttime security guard to patrol the alley and maintain a presence to make the residents feel more secure. I will say again, once you are in the building, you feel extremely safe, security cameras throughout  and the apartments have solid core doors with high quality locks and hotel-type interior nighttime  bolts. You don't see strangers wandering around the building. 

There has been a building going up between The Viktoria and Pike Place, which means we have had to deal with the constant construction noise since we moved in. Fortunately, it's almost completed, but there are other tall buildings scheduled to go up around us in the near future and we expect the noise to continue.

However, I'd hardly refer to it as a nightmare either.  These reviews are truly a shame since they probably have detered a few folks from signing a lease here - I know I almost was convinced to take my business elsewhere, but I'm glad that I didn't.  This certainly isn't to say the apartment complex is flawless. Security could be tighter, but the fence around the building is an improvement over most other local apartment buildings. Additionally, I have seen some unseemly looking individuals lurking around the parking lot near building three, but as long as you stay out of that area, you shouldn't have any problems.  The rent is great, however. Utilities aren't that expensive (especially if it's split between two people). The shuttle service is very prompt in the morning, and while it seems to run on a bit more of an irregular schedule in the afternoon, you normally don't have to wait more than 15 minutes or so (often less) - If you're in such a big hurry, you can park for $3 bucks for the day at the metro lot, pay 25 cents to take the Fairfax connector across the street from Riverside, or even walk back.  The apartment was clean when I arrived and while a few things weren't working, A/C and hot water, it only took one call to get those fixed. My roommate's A/C unit needed to be replaced, but it only took a little while for it to be fixed. (My hot water has been giving me some problems recently, though.)  The fact that you have to pay $25-$50 bucks if you lock yourself out after hours is pretty unfair (especially if you only do it once), but I haven't had any other problems.  The bathrooms tend to have poorer insulation, so you can usually hear voices from above or below, but the rest of the rooms are quiet and most neigbors are pretty considerate. There is considerable diversity in the truest sense of the word at Riverside: College kids and seniors, singles and families, whites, ------, ---------, professionals, laborers, students, and bumper stickers for both Bush and Kerry.  Other nice features are card activated laundry machines and a package room.

5/9/2014,41768,5.0,"Just moved here to be closer to work, and can safely say it was one of the best decisions we've ever made.

First off, for us, the location can't be beat. We didn't want to live in a high-rise near the Silver Spring Metro (too busy) and the Citron is a smaller, five-story building on the fringe of the residential area of Silver Spring but still within a block of downtown. The smaller building really fosters a sense of community, which we love. Turn left out of the front entrance, and you're 1/2 mile from Sligo Creek Park. Turn right, and you're one or two blocks away from great restaurants, Whole Foods, movie theaters, and hair salons. Six or seven blocks to Silver Spring Metro. 

OK, so the location is nice, right? But if you're living in a junky apartment, does location really matter? Good thing we don't have to worry about that. The property is BEAUTIFUL. Every detail, from the landscaping to the fitness center, is impeccable. The concierge is always friendly, and the leasing office staff is TOP NOTCH. Our apartment is beautifully appointed, with stainless steel appliances, high efficiency full-size washer and dryer, balcony. The floors, paint, light fixtures and granite counter tops are high quality. These details matter to me, and Citron really delivers. They also offer reserved, gated access garage parking (at the time this review was written, $125 a month) but the garage is located directly underneath the building, so you can elevator straight up to your apartment. We don't currently take advantage of this, but it's nice to know that we have a secure place to park should we want it. There are also free, secure bike cages in the same garage to lock up your bicycles.

There's also a pool and lounge area. Free coffee in the lobby is an added bonus! Online portal for residents, so paying rent and submitting maintenance work order requests are all in one place and can be taken care of 24/7. If you're an Amazon.com fanatic like me, and you get packages delivered weekly, you'll love the email they send you when you have a package waiting. 

Let's get to the price. Do what we did; Google every apartment building in the Silver Spring area... you'll narrow it down to six or seven candidates. Then read the reviews and let them speak for themselves. The Citron is probably one of the top two most expensive choices, but for us, it is worth EVERY PENNY. I would rather pay a little extra every month for peace of mind that I'm living in a safe, clean, quality building where my maintenance requests are completed in less than 24 hours and the leasing office knows me by first name.

The movie room! The pool table! The lounge! The fitness center! The exercise classes like Yoga and Zumba! All fantastic. Living Space: I can only speak from my own experience, but in addition to the great bathroom and kitchen fixtures/appliances, I've been impressed by how quiet the apartment is. I don't hear noise from the hallway and I've never heard noise come through the walls. Staff: The staff works hard to make Union Wharf feel like home. From the leasing office to the in-house handymen to the housekeeping staff, the folks who work here know good customer service. Finally, Location: In Fells Point you're steps from anything you need. Grocery store, hardware store, 7/11, Royal Farms, plus limitless bars & restaurants. The waterfront promenade is great for running or walking.

12/13/2007,39429,2.0,"Here's the rundown on what seem to be the big issues: MANAGEMENT They re okay. They don t talk to me and I don t talk to them. That s the way I like it. MAINTENANCE All those people care about is not getting fired. When they paint the apartments, they paint everything. Hinges, light switches, even the corners of the carpet get painted. If you have a problem, they will come out right away. But they fix a problem to the absolute minimum standard. If you are very specific and say, I am having X problem, I need Y solution, they will try to do it. APARTMENT: Very large. Lots of closets. Crappy appliances and fixtures. PRICE: Cheapest in the area. PARKING: There are always empty spaces. Some are a little walk. Maybe it's from living on L.A., but I'm of the opinion that leftover spaces means there is enough parking. GROUNDS: Not really very attractive, but they could be much worse. HOT WATER: There is hot water, but not enough. If you want to take a shower at 6:30 or 7:00 am, you will get luke warm water at best. Or it will be hot for 20 seconds and then get cold. It will not be pleasant. METRO SHUTTLE Very convenient if you work normal hours, but it only runs during rush hour. It's often late when there s traffic on Huntington, but I don t really think that s Riverside s fault. ROACHES: Some people have them. Some don't. I had roaches when I first moved in. Riverside will send out ""exterminators"" who won't actually do anything helpful. I eradicated the problem myself by emptying my kitchen, covering every surface with boric acid, and leaving it that way for 2 months. I'm not joking. I really did that, but I haven't seen a roach since. THE NOISE: Maybe some spots are different, but my section of the building was eerily quiet. Then again, maybe it's because before I was here I lived in a rowdy college neighborhood. Make some more noise people! SECURITY/SAFETY Security is a complete joke. The people at the front gate will let anyone in. Anyone can just walk right into the buildings. But the area is fine. It s not the best. It s not the worst. Cars get broken into everywhere.

4/23/2014,41752,1.0,"I'll get straight to the point: this place is very over-priced for what you get. There are plenty of other places in the gulch,downtown, etc worth the money. Don't waste yours here. 

Here's why:
I write this review as I sit outside waiting for the fire alarm to be turned off..yet again. 

This has happened at least 10 times (probably more) since I moved in 9 months ago. 

Now, I'm in the construction business and understand that new buildings have their initial issues, but this has become blatant disregard on the part of the building owner and maintenance staff. This issue should be fixed by now. 

Secondly, if you want to relive your college dorm days, this is the place for you. A large portion of the residents ( I emphasize not all of course but a significant portion) have no respect for their neighbors or this brand new building. 

The set off fire extinguishers in the halls; they key several cars in the garage;
they leave pet waste in the hallways, garage, and stairwells regularly (which by the way stays there for days);
they go through a phase if spitting on the wall (yes, this lasted about a month);
 they steal pool chairs;
they break the elevators by stuffing their entire wild party into it etc etc

Oh and what happens when I tell the leasing office about the car keying? They tell me they are shocked and have never had that happen...when I know for a fact two others have complained to the office about it. The women in the office are very nice upfront but definitely have a ""sorry 'bout your luck"" approach. 

Thirdly, this building was not well-constructed. The craftsmanship was awful. Shown most prominently by the large flood we had last fall. But other examples: A large piece of my granite counter is broken and epoxied back on, leaving about a quarter inch crack. Large cracks and chips are in the bath tub. There are saw marks in the trim and the cabinet drawers are not all square, showing a rushed job. Small paint  spots were left on the floor. I could go on. 

Again there are plenty of other options to live (and growing). Choose somewhere else. if Pine Street wants to remain in the competition they better step it up. 

As I have written this, the alarm has been turned off long enough for us all to go upstairs. And then it was set off three more times. This whole ordeal has lasted 45 minutes thus far. Time to rush to work!",1.0,Silver,50.0,1.0,0.0

No help, guidance, or notification from apartment building. You can find glass throughout the entire garage at the moment.

8/27/2002,37495,1.0,"All right, here is my unbiased review of The Fillmore Center for the uninitiated, or anyone from out of town thinking about moving into this place. I´m the most level-minded person there is, but there are some very negative things about living here that, sadly, detract from what might otherwise be an okay place to live.  The Fillmore Center is a pretty big apartment complex made up of several large towers and sprawling mid-level townhouses. There are two large courtyards, several underground parking lots, a gym, and some nice landscaping. The apartments are clean, bright, and fairly spacious for San Francisco, and they are fairly new, being about a dozen years old. The appliances include a dishwasher and microwave, two big timesavers if you ask me. The construction seems pretty good, although when we moved in there was a big water stain on the ceiling. Our leasing agent casually forgot to mention that the roof leaked, so during our first rainy season in our apartment, we had water dripping down on our furniture. Someone told me that they spent a lot of money redoing the roofs, well apparently they didn´t get it right. In all fairness, the landlord gave us a month of free rent for putting up with the leak.  Now on to the bad stuff. We moved here several years ago before the whole dot com thing drove up rents to sky-high levels. Then we got a lesson in GREEDY LANDLORDS. We were good tenants, always paid our rent on time, never complained, always quiet, etc. Then they raised our rent four hundred dollars. How many people can afford a four hundred dollar rent increase? Can you? I called anonymously the next day and was told that the same unit rented for even less than our old lease! When I revealed that I was a tenant and wanted to take advantage of the new lower rent, they became enraged and told me I wasn´t eligible. I either had to sign the new lease which was six hundred dollars more than the market rate, or move out. We chose to move out. Great way to run a business, isn´t it? Drive the tenants away rather than compromise. I don´t believe I´ll ever understand their business acumen (or lack thereof).  Like everyone else has said, the agents are oh so friendly and polite and smiling and laughing when you walk in and sign the lease, but the moment you sign you are treated like dirt. They never return phone calls, don´t even bother to look at you or say hi when you´re waiting for the shuttle. Nikki got in the elevator with me one day and I said hello to her but she just looked at me like I was some filthy street person or something. Just a month before, I was sitting in her office and she was laughing and chatting away with me, BEFORE I signed the lease of course. That bleached-blonde cow needs to learn some manners.  The neighborhood is scary, approaching super-scary status at night. There is a Safeway across the street, but it´s filthy and dirty like some sort of third-world grocery. One of the cashiers went crazy and started cutting a customer with a shard of glass. Roving gangs walk up and down the sidewalks all night yelling ""woo-hoo!"", shooting things, and beating up people. Once a week there is some sort of police posse; the police cars suddenly come storming out of the station like a bunch of angry hornets, and they all converge on one of the many, many housing projects that surround the Fillmore Center. This is NOT a safe neighborhood, not at night, not during the day.  The garage is dark, dirty, and dangerous. A woman was raped in the garage. The door breaks regularly and anyone can just walk inside. The courtesy patrol used to do regular walk-throughs of the garage, but that doesn´t happen any more. Someone poured some kind of strange liquids all over some stuff I had in the garage, I had to throw it all out.  The last thing: what kind of scam does the management at The Fillmore Center have going on with the deposits? Everyone I have talked to who moved out of there did not get their full deposit back. We documented our clean apartment, even did a walk-through, and got back all but $100. I was on my hands and knees for two days scrubbing that apartment, and they still dinged us for some imaginary dirt somewhere. Someone should file a class-action lawsuit against the management of the Fillmore Center to refund all the tenants´ deposits. The problem is that the refund is solely at the discretion of the management, with absolutely no input whatsoever from the tenants. Why, I´m willing to bet that no one has ever received their full deposit back from the Fillmore Center. What do they do with all that extra money? Suffice it to say that if you move here, you won´t get your full deposit back.  Well, you´ve been warned. Stay away from this place.  Far, far away.",0.0,Non-Certified,45.0,0.0,0.0

- new, updated units
- top notch amenities

Unfortunately, even though this place had the potential to be one of the best in the city. They have a manager and sales staff that are liars and will do anything to take your money. I've lived in over 10 apartment buildings and can confidently say this is the worst I've EVER experienced.

Dog policy- lies
- lied to me about where my dog was allowed and charged me $650 to have a dog in the building when she is only allowed in my unit and in the PUBLIC dog park. 

Gave our neighbors key fobs
The high rise apartment next to us gets to access the amenities WE PAY FOR

Pool and restaurant - lies 
Was promised in February that they would be open in the next 1-1.5 months. They both didn't open until June/July respectively

Rules are worse than elementary school
Even if you are cooking a hot dog and it's not even busy, the manager is constantly looking out her window to see if there's someone who doesn't live there with more than 2 guests. I've witnessed it twice. 

If you have more than 2 guests INSIDE in the common area you HAVE to pay $150 to rent out a party room. Yes... for 4 people. (Email attached) 

Air conditioning broken
It's a brand new building and we had no air conditioning all of april and may and has gone out for a few days here and there this summer with NO communication

Water damage/sprinkler flood
Don't get me wrong, I feel awful because I'm sure this has been a nightmare for management, but my god, we pay thousands of dollars a month to live in a high rise apartment (36 floors) in river north and all of the elevators were out for 1 day and we have only had 1 elevator for the past 2 weeks!!!!

They don´t really seem to know what´s going on around them, and they never have answers to any questions.  Mail/package delivery can be a problem. Packages are often lost or sit in the delivery area for days before you´re notified about them.  I´ve never had any big problems with the parking garage. It´s expensive, but I feel secure keeping my car there.  There are some nice amenities like the video store, dry cleaners, and convenience store. The grocery store is ridiculously overpriced, though, and the food selection is pretty vile.

What we found was that the amenities were great but the traffic, crime, and noise was definitely not our thing. We considered purchasing however home investments today are certainly not what they use to be. One Saturday heading to a friends place we found ourselves stopped at a light both staring at a beautifully built well constructed building with an advertisement sign stating pet friendly ( we love our pooches ) and the appropriate leasing information to contact the office. We called and the friendly voice on the other end ( Jorgen ) answered all of our immediate questions and then some. We found ourselves extremely excited to take a tour. We both knew half through the tour that we were going to call this home. Every detail has been thought of, nothing was cheeped  out. Quality construction, quality fixtures, and oh yeah the amenities are better than our fancy high rise offered. I love my technology and this place is loaded with it. Our cars reside in the large private heated garage, we have more space than we need, and the staff we not only got to know but we feel we can call them our friends. Brandi and Jorgen in the leasing office make everything seamless from the application to the move in. Very professional, very efficient, and extremely helpful. Michael in Engineering doesn't take days to rectify a work order it's literally done in hours. A first class building, fitted with a first class staff, and it is in the quaintest little town anyone could ask for.

11/17/2018,43421,1.0,"""When you think Vita can't get worse, it just did. "" This is the common joke happening between residents waiting for the elevator. ""Nothing works here"" then we all laugh.
1. In general only one of the elevators works, waiting for 20 mins is the norm. You are lucky if you don't live on higher floors like us. We had to lift groceries to the 25th floor a few times because all six elevators were out of service.
2. Safety is a big issue here
2.1 People who don't live here can easily get in. They steal the Apple key boards in the business areas, and hang out in our recreation areas and leave trash. One random person got into the ""secure"" building, got into the ""secure"" gym, took a dumbbell, then went up to the 28th floor, and threw the dumbbell through a window in the hallway. It landed on the 3rd floor terrace area where residents often hangout or have BBQs. Luckily no one got injured. We have repeatedly raised the safety issue of people pigging backing into VITA but no action has been taken from Vita for the past 2 years we lived here.
2.2 One morning around 7am we smelled a terrible gas smell in the hallway on our way to work. We called the Vita front desk, and no one picked up. We went to the concierge desk, and no one was there. We called Vita office line, and the lady on the phone listened to me sharing the issue, and said she would take care of it. I waited at the concierge for 20 mins and no VITA employee showed up, so I called back to Vita office line, and the same lady said she actually was only responsible for people who are interested in moving into Vita, and existing residence were not her problem. I asked if any security person in Vita can help check the gas smell before I call 911, and she said there was no security person onsite. My husband and I then called 911 and took our laptops and passports and escaped the building. That was 8:15am. During the entire 1 hour and 15 mins, we didn't see any Vita employee despite searching multiple floors. 
2.3 Residence, including some Vita employees, smoke cigarette and weeds in the garage, and left an open fire in a trash can. We reported the fire hazard multiple times to VITA, and we got yelled at by Carol the front desk lady that there is nothing VITA can do about this.
2.4 I was once in the Vita elevator, and it dropped multiple floors incredibly quickly. I pressed every button to slow it down and it finally did stop. When I crawled out of the elevator, I wanted to call Vita and ask them to put a sign for this elevator that people shouldn't use it before a thorough check. Vita told me I had to get the elevator number inside of the elevator, otherwise they won't be able to identify which elevator. I didn't want to get back in that elevator, so I described the position of the elevator, but they refused to do anything. I used the stairs to get to the lobby, and saw residences were getting on that exact malfunctioned elevator. Vita never checked this elevator and it remained in-use as far as I know.
3. Poor management
3.1 We used the online system Vita provided us to set up our rent payment, but the rent amount was wrong. We raised to Vita's attention and hoped they can sync up the system. Vita claimed the online system"" Conservice is a third party company that send residence the bill"", so it's our fault to expect they communicate with their online system.
3.2 We made a reservation of the elevator for our move-out, we knew Vita would likely drop the ball like everything they did, so we triple confirmed with the concierge our reservation of the elevator (9am~12am) was successful, 1 week before the move, 3 days before the move, 1 day before the move. Guess what, on the morning of our move-out day, they had no clue who took the elevator, and it took us with our movers 20 mins to go floor by floor to find which floor the elevator was locked at. Of course, Vita had let someone else use the elevator despite our efforts to confirm our appointment.
3.3 A hassle to get your mail packages. Front desk Carol often claims they don't have your packages, and it's your responsibility to talk to shipping companies. Every time, we asked a different front desk person to help us, they would locate our packages. Avoid Carol when you can.
4. Tons of issues with the underground parking 
Can you image no lights in the garage, pitch dark. Yes, it is very common here that not a single light will work in the underground garage. Make sure you have a flashlight when you park.

4/23/2016,42483,1.0,"I moved into 1160 as one of the first residents when they were still under construction. I want to take the opportunity to provide an honest review, not out of anger or emotion, but based on fact. For the first six months, I loved living at 1160. The location is convenient and my apartment was brand new, there weren't many residents so the leasing office knew me by first name and checked on me periodically to ensure everything was going great. I was told that free yoga and spinning classes would begin in a few months- understandable as the building was still under construction. After my six months living there, my experience went downhill. I started to notice stress cracks in the walls all over my bedroom. It has taken 6 months to get maintenance to repair them. I woke up in the middle of the night for several nights to the sound of plastic bags being rummaged through. I ignored it at first until I started to see my bananas and loaf of bread half way eaten when I woke up in the morning with animal droppings in my kitchen. Yup, rats. I directly contacted the leasing office on FOUR different occasions within a two day period to tell them of the issue. Then in person a few more times. I was told that the maintenance guy had fixed the issue while I was at work one day. I felt better until the next morning when I woke up to more rat droppings in my kitchen. I moved out into my friend's place and demanded that I receive each daily rent fee reimbursed to me every day I didn't stay at home due to the issue. I was told the issue would be handled ASAP. I checked my apartment two days later- found a dead rat in a trap in my HVAC room. After threatening to go on Yelp as other sites to make the community aware of what was going on, the manager at the time, Laura, called me personally and told me that she would personally handle the issue. This went on for 2-3 weeks until finally Orkin came and the issue was fixed. I am still too scared to open the HVAC room several months later. I was told by the maintenance guy at the time that at least four other residents complained about the same issue. By the way, I received $250 off of my rent for the nightmare. I was assured that security would be outstanding before I signed my lease. It is important especially because I am a single young woman living alone. I came home after work one night to my apartment being broken into with a crowbar. My iPad, laptop, all of my jewelry (which was even hidden away in a good spot), and many other items were stolen. The police came and thank goodness I had renter's insurance because I was reimbursed for the most part. I couldn't understand how it happened especially with our ""security guard"", key fob access to the building, and cameras ""all over the building"" as I was promised upon moving in. The robber's foot print was left on the wall in the hall across from my apartment (must have braced himself against the wall). I was confident they'd catch the guy. The police then told me there is one camera only near the main entrance to the leasing office and one camera when driving into the garage. I was assured by management that they'd bump up security big time after this happened. More than six months later, the robber's footprint is still on the wall- nobody has bothered to paint over it. Just last week I walked out to the garage to several residents and police crowded around the area- 4 or 5 cars had been broken into. Glass shattered. Turns out the garage entry gate has been broken for weeks. There is still only ONE camera at the garage entry. Super difficult to pinpoint who could've done this with five huge levels. By the way, I installed an alarm system. I asked leasing to repair my door and they replaced it, but the door knob is still banged up many months later. The little issues that I've dealt with are ant infestations, teenagers/young people screaming and talking loudly at all hours of the night during the week at the pool area with nothing being done about it (I hardly sleep those nights- ear plugs have helped), huge dark scuffle marks all over the hallway walls on my floor, delivery personnel find it impossible to locate the building- I give full blown instructions how to locate the leasing office every time I have something delivered, and there has never been a free yoga or spinning class as I was told there would be. There are more issues but I have already written so much. Main point is that I thought that I had finally found a great residence for professionals that would be worth the expensive fee that I pay for rent every month. I have been extremely disappointed and feel that I've wasted my time and money on living here. I'm looking forward to moving out when my lease is over.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0
5/12/2016,42502,2.0,"Below is a summary of my experience living at Slate Apartments with my husband and two pets for one year:

Location: Great location! Just 3 bus stops to Ballard and in my opinion this is a better location than Ballard as far as commuting to work, because you don't have to worry about the bridge. Traffic is absolutely a nightmare in the city, so you will have some traffic down 15 getting to work (bus or by car) though there is a great bike path to downtown (Elliott bay trail) if you bike to work. Interbay is a great neighborhood. If you have a dog, there are plenty of places to walk around with them. As in any urban environment you should be careful at night (there can be some drifters in the area) but other than that the neighborhood is nestled between two of Seattle's safest (Magnolia/Queen Anne). The fields draw families and students and there is very much a police presence watching over the neighborhood.  I would feel safe here with kids and pets here!

The people & the dogs: The staff is really great. They went above and beyond, especially Rumel, he was fantastic and really helped us out a great deal when we had an apartment problem come up. There are a lot of transplants, which was great for us being new to Seattle. We made a lot of friends in our building and met some really fantastic dogs too!

Noise & construction: The apartment can be a bit noisy. The building is part of the ever popular mid-rise wood framing. This was very bothersome to me. Though, this is very common here in Seattle so you should be aware of this problem in any new building. If you are not on the top floor or a foundation floor, you will be able to hear and feel everything above you. On my 5th floor unit I knew when someone opened the door to their apartment, and could even tell if people were walking in the hallway on the 6th floor! If upstairs noise bothers you, ask the leasing staff which foundation floors would be best for you or opt for the top floor.

Outside Noise: This didn't bother me much, but it bothered my partner. I have a lot of friends in the building and have spent considerable time on just about every side and they all have their pros and cons. We faced the train tracks, which did not bother me after a couple weeks. I rather miss the sound of the trains (though they can bang against each other occasionally while they attach themselves) but I really liked the gentle chug chug sound they made. Some sides have street noise and others have the fields which have games going on a bit. If a particular outside noise bothers you more than another just ask the leasing office and they will help you.

Aside from wood framing, I was very happy with my experience at Slate. This is a great place for a native or a transplant.",1.0,Gold,61.0,2.0,0.0

9/29/2005,38624,4.0,"I moved into Falkland Chase with my fiancee in mid 2001. The things we liked most about this community and continue to like about this community are:1. Park like setting. It really seems a world away from the metropolitan area it is in.2. Very relaxed pet policy. Falkland chase is one of a handful of places in Silver Spring, ney, Montgomery county that will allow large dogs. You may have up to two.3. Right next to the silver spring metro and bus station.4. Maintenance is pretty responsive.There is more to this list, but these are the big ones.The negatives are:1. The apartments are old. I think they were built in the 1940's and it shows. Nothing has been done to the interiors to modernize them. There is about 40 coats of paint on the walls. I'm sure some of it is lead based. It would appear that when a new tenant moves in they don't the least amount work possible to get the apartment ready.2. The kitchens are a joke in the townhouses. They are ridiculously small and all the major appliances are about 3/4 scale. Space to put pots and pans is limited. If you enjoy cooking you will get pretty frustrated quickly.3. We have had some rent problems and, no, we have never, ever paid late in my over 4 years of being here. We have had a court summons issued to us for a screw up on their end, which seemed extremely ridiculous considering they could have just contacted us about any back rent or whatever. However, this occured when Avalon Bay was the owner of the community so I'm hoping Home Properties is a little better with their accounting.4. The amenity is a total waste of money and if you are thinking about moving here I would try and get that waived. The only amenities I see are one fitness center and two dog runs. The fitness center is a joke. If they invested some money in it could be really nice. But the loction is in a basement of one of the building and it get really musty in there. All of the equipment is over 4 years old and is beat to hell and the free weights are rusting. The dog run is just a fenced of portion of the property. You compare these amenities to the amenties next door at Lenox Park (which has a huge pool, a really nice fitness center, security, front desk, etc.) and you really question what that fee is used for.There are more negatives, but mostly they may come down to personal taste. This place is a true find for this area. The dog thing is a big factor. We moved in some time ago, so our rent is much lower than what they are charging for market. If we had to pay more than $2000 for the townhouse we are in I might consider finding another place, but of course I don't know where we would go with our two large dogs.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,1.0

Moved in to a really nice apartment, the black granite countertops with the cherry wood cabinets were really pleasing to they eye and made for a great living space.

Through the 3.5 months I lived there, I had no complaints, other than how far we had to walk to throw away trash on the first floor (perhaps inherent in apartment complexes), all alcohol being banned from the pools, and minor construction errors (kitchen counter tiles maligned & paint spots on the hardwood floor)

Other than that the ladies in the front office and Brock (go Brock! :D) were great, and made the short but sweet stay quite worthwhile, and were very helpful in last minute cancellations to my lease. Also it's hard to argue with being 15 minutes from Broadway, Demonbreun, and Midtown by foot!

I visited with a school group in May and looked at three apartments that day, one of which was Left Bank. While the other apartments were closer to my workplace, this building gave me the best bang for my buck. The building is newer, and the apartments are well constructed. The amenities are nice and the washer/dryer in unit was probably the biggest perk for me. In short, it fit for what I needed. Now having living here a few months, there are a few observations I hope you find useful. As other comments note, we are surrounded by trains. In fact, you can see almost every mode of transportation outside our windows - boats, trains, buses, el, plane, etc etc. And yes, the el and trains do run all night. The building is almost completely surrounded by metra/amtrak tracks. We asked for a high floor to avoid this and it worked: while I can hear the el and the trains, it does not disrupt TV watching or conversations. I'm not sure what it would be like any lower, but I can imagine lower floors might be a little louder. It is quite loud when I open my windows - we tend to keep them closed anyway. The AC is individually controlled (to a certain extent; no cool air in the dead of winter!) and quiet comfortable to an open window is not always needed. The building is pet friendly (brought my cat) and it is a younger crowd in the building. Only a block away from the Clinton Green/Pink stop, Olgive is close, but there are not too many buses in the immediate area. But the neighborhood is blooming. A new beautiful eco-friendly Jewel opened two and 1/2 blocks away, the closest watering hole is a block away and there are emerging stores and restaurants in the area. A new park just opened in late fall two blocks away too. There is an attached parking garage with indoor access from the building. Last I checked it was $215 a month, unlimited in/out. And my neighbor tends to be loud and I can hear through his door in the hallway, but rarely have I heard him through our walls. In the end, if you have doubts, you gotta see it.

Vision on Wilshire is my home & I LOVE it here! 

This is going to be a super long review to help those who may be on the fence, but for the tl;dr crowd, this is the best apartment you can get in mid-wilshire hands down! 

I was looking for an apartment in the beautiful Mid-Wilshire part of LA and had toured multiple buildings, and Vision was the last one that I had planned to check out. I called and scheduled an appointment with Olga who was a pleasure and always made herself available to answer any of my questions that I had. 

Upon arriving to tour the building, Olga greeted me immediately upon entering the lobby, and in my mind I already was half sold! I am a very particular person and when it comes to where I am going to live, I want to make sure that I am going to be comfortable, safe, and feel at home. I also notice all of the fine little details, and it is safe to say that no expenses were spared here. Everything is TOP quality and BEAUTIFUL! The lobby is reminiscent of a 5 star hotel, high vaulted ceilings, coffee and nespresso machines for all of the guests, beautiful modern and contemporary artwork, and a beautiful grand tile floor. This is my type of building!

Olga took us up and showed us a few of the units and I feel in love with EVERYTHING! I knew I was sold but I held my excitement in while Olga was giving us a tour! I picked a unit on the 9th floor with a beautiful view that I am enjoying every day! The unit has hardwood floors, brand new Bosch appliances including a washer and dryer which was a must for me! The closets are huge and you have plenty of space to store things and keep your apartment looking nice and organized! The kitchen cabinets are a beautiful gloss white and EVERY SINGLE cabinet and door is soft close which is a quality touch. If you are a detailed minded person you will really notice all of the fine details that went into each and every unit. The units also have Nest Thermostats, and everything is so safe and secure here which makes you feel relaxed and comfortable at all times. Once you go on a tour you will agree with me, everything is top quality here! 

Olga then showed me all of the fantastic amenities that I am now using on a regular basis like the state of the art gym, 5th floor conference and office rooms, and the rooftop pool and jacuzzi and fire pits! This place has it all! The rooftop is dream like, you have 360 degree views of all of LA, and best of all, everything is 24/7!! 

After the tour, as you can imagine, I was sold, and after a quick application process I was all set in under 30 minutes! Olga was professional, attentive, and very understanding of all of my needs. Two weeks later I was moved in! Upon entering my apartment for the first time Olga had purchased tons of snacks and drinks and food to stock my fridge! It was such a nice gesture and I knew I was home!

Now after living here for over 3 months, I can 100% say with confidence if your looking to live in Mid-Wilshire, Vision on Wilshire is by far the best option. It is slightly more expensive then the other apartment buildings, but when you consider the quality of the units, the amenities, the helpful staff who are all superb, Raj, Daisha, Nico, Olga, Eris, Samson, Austin, and all of the other wonderful staff members, then you will quickly realize that Vision has plenty of value over the competition. 

They also have wonderful resident events hosted every few weeks for residents to interact and get to know each other which is another nice touch! All of my neighbors and residents that I've met are all very kind and a pleasure to talk with. 

To finish, I could not be any happier with my home at Vision on Wilshire, I am another happy resident who is proud to call Vision on Wilshire my home :)",1.0,Silver,54.0,5.0,1.0

Since moving in, there has been problem after problem, complaint after complaint and yet, nobody seems to care.  Recently, I, as the supposed customer, reached out to terminate lease as I feel it is best for both parties (management and myself) involved.  They are yet to come to the table with a valid plan to make this happen.  I have been told that this process is ""silent"" on purpose so, in the meantime, I will divulge the events that led to this.  Remember, ALL of these events have occurred in 6 months and I don't want this to happen to YOU!

Mail
-I was unable to receive mail for an extended period.  It was stated that the USPS did not recognize the building's address and simply stopped delivering.  How the hell can this happen? In addition to this, all Luxor One deliveries were stopped.

A/C
-Was without a/c for a period of time.  Work orders were entered repeatedly.  You'd think that for a new building, everything would work properly or checklists completed prior to allowing a tenant move in.

Flood & Elevators
-Within the first few weeks of living, there was a massive flood.  This took out multiple elevators and caused disruption for weeks.  Part of the rental agreement was an agreement to the amenities.  With the time lost in lines awaiting the elevator, no credit or good natured gesture was provided.

Smoking
-This building is a so called ""non smoking building.""  My neighbors toke up daily and if it isn't 420, its cigs.  I have 4 complaints in because the draft of the building causes the smoke to enter my unit.  Nothing has been done.

Pool behavior
-Glass management is beyond poor yet many complying tenants are harassed daily, including myself. 

Secondary Flood
-A neighbor allowed his bathroom to flood thus causing water to come through the wall and take out my $400 rug and various other items on the floor.  Not a single call was made from management to let me know that anything was going on.  When returning from a weekend trip, I was welcomed to industrial fans running in the unit as well as my shit simply dumped into the bath tub for ""drying.""  The lack of communication and respect in this ordeal is unprofessional and unacceptable.

They treat us like crap and have made it clear we are just rent checks to them. This is the most expensive building on the block, but the management's official response to things breaking is ""not our problem, just pay your rent"". Its the ultimate bait and switch. I expect to be treated this way for a $600 a month slum, not a $2600 a month ""luxury"" building.

The pool and gym are nicer than any that I have seen at other apartments, and high-quality instructors actually teach several classes weekly.

Also, the community here is very welcoming, fun, but also respectful.

2/27/2016,42427,1.0,"GET EVERYTHING in WRITING - units are overpriced:

1. renters pay less on 30th than 24th, with bigger space /better layout

2. berkshire communities has shady business practices and salespeople that lie.  

3. Monthly utilities increase every month - NOT transparent - calculated usage on unit residency. Total building usage is divided amongst units, regardless of how many people live in each unit.  Pay for monthly party water /energy?

4. berkshire lied about transfer to another property when I had to move for work - invoiced for $4,210 then $12K+ despite refusal to lease for less than a year when doing so for others.

5. 6mos for smaller key fob. had to sign form.  When I returned key I had to ask 3 times to have them sign - they lost original form - $50 still not refunded

6. Unsafe. Infrequent concierge.  Lose /misplace keys or they stop working - could wait an hour or more.

7. Unsafe. Robberies. Gun sighting. One glass entrance. Transients nearby park sleep at parking garage entrance.  Easy entrance to follow vehicles in.  Approached by non-tenant in P3 elevator underground.  They get in!  Scary.

8. Unsafe. System alerts floors 2 above and 1 below.  One night, I had to take the stairs from the 25th floor because the elevators weren't working - late for meeting.  When I got outside, there were fire trucks and a fire, but no alarm!

9. Unsafe. Elevators break down frequently. Access to all floors is open due to monthly parties on the roof.

10. Residents never informed of monthly parties on roof (restricted use and loud - so lack of peaceful enjoyment) - frequent damage to amenities that is never fixed /not monitored.  Bathrooms frequently run out of toilet paper /paper towel and since elevators are so slow... Well, you get it.

11. Roof area has poor internet quality for gym use and online reading.

12. Gym hours reduced for no

13. Staff response time to issues such as noise (paper thin walls) ranges from unresponsive to ""we didn't see /hear anything""

14. You can hear people talking outside the heavy doors and through the walls; you can hear dogs barking; you can hear people taking the stairs in the stairwells (which are unfinished, btw) and in elevator.  

15. NO PRIVACY - overhear confidential conversations and my secure internet was hacked!

16. Washer /dryer combo is tiny AND has incredible amounts of fluff that comes out onto your clothes.

17. Fridges are tiny and veggies and fruit don't last long.

18. Heavy doors in garage - terrible for shopping /heavy bags or moving anything.  NO WHEELCHAIR ACCESS - the laugh is, that there is a wheelchair button on the elevator - doesn't do anything.

19. Garbage Shute is frequently not working or locked (lasted hours /days /months).  Buttons for recycling /garbage don't light up and building is new! 

20. Heaters on roof never worked then removed for entire winter.

21. Barbecues don't always work - there is a plug outlet AND an on switch - no signage for this and staff don't know this and when informed - they taped a sign to bbq lid - melted so they had no sign.  wow - indicative of overall staff level.

22. Piped music - building staff stated multiple times that volume could not be changed (lack of peaceful enjoyment of amenities) and then only they can change it... but had to be told - and when they are told - still doesn't get changed timely - very loud multiple times so cannot read a book, listen to .

23. Tenants frequently left garbage in garage, including banana peels

24. Initially told (inducement to rent) that guests could park for free and this was then changed and no guests allowed, while they allow day parking by non-residents (unsafe access issue) who get bigger parking space!

25. Unsafe and unsightly - packages delivered are left unattended 

26. Loud vacuums in cleaning hallways - appears to be only one staff for this, which is why the building /floors are dirty for significant parts of time - also - shows how thin walls /doors are and take up precious elevator time.

27. Heating - hot and dry - your AC is constantly working to maintain balance AND unit (for one bedrooms) is located in bedroom, which means you pay to balance the air in one room, while the area by the window is significantly colder.

28. Water pressure fluctuates, as does water temperature.  It takes more than a minute for hot water - so expect cold hands and more water use to heat your shower and for anyone with thick hair.

29. Salesperson induced to sign for rent pmt by credit card without fees - there is a significant % fee.  They want your banking info.  You should be able to deposit to their bank because once you provide your info - they have access and based on the lack of controls identified in banking and basic operations, I wouldn't trust their controls over your personal info.

30. Elevators always take forever.  31 floors and most of the time only one elevator; locked for maintenance parties move - endless stories on this.

When my girlfriend moved in they charged her $50 fee claiming her check bounced, but her bank sent her a letter stating that the check had never been presented to it.  Then when she moved out early, they tried to charge her a month's rent as a penalty, despite the fact that she had an affordable dwelling unit for which there was a waiting list.  A call from the Fall Church City affordable dwelling program fixed that immediately.  Then after she moved out, they sent her a bill that included a ""fee"" that they refused to explain and a claim for $75 in ""damages"" because some of the slats in the incredibly cheap plastic vertical blinds were broken.  I lived in apartments with blinds like that for years, and a literally every other place--including other Lincoln properties, the maintenance staff would fix that for free because they tend to fall apart if used.  She sent them a check for damage to the carpet (totally legitimate) and asked them to explain the other stuff.  No response from management.

The Elevator in the ""East"" building is often broken. I've counted 12 times in 2 years where the elevator has been unavailable, at times for an extended period, 2-4 days. This entire complex and building is/was brand new when I moved in. Check with the Medford Fire Department. The fire alarm has gone off constantly, at least once per month. The appliances, while nice, aren't too durable. Another issue with the ""East"" building is the subdivision of the underground parking lot. They had too little parking for the shops so they had to add additional parking by carving out spaces in the resident parking. In order to park in the East building you need to go through 2 garage doors. The top garage door has been broken 3 times in the last 2 years. Then there's the constant construction. I figured after the first year things would improve, but instead they decided to construct a third apartment complex. The construction would start at 7am weekday mornings, including the pounding noise of driving in the foundation pillars. Complaints to the apartment management were ignored about the early start time. The intersection at RT28 / RT16 is troublesome, add the construction and if you drive instead of taking the T, can be very annoying just to get out of the parking lot. The planner for the project and the shops did a poor job of understanding available parking, it can be a nightmare trying to get into the garage with people visiting the shops and clogging the parking lot. The shops are the best part of living here. Having several restaurants of differing styles can be very convenient. Otherwise everything else has been inadequate.

8/21/2015,42237,5.0,"If you're like me, you came to Yelp to find out what people are saying about apartments in DC. I noticed that Parc Riverside didn't have any reviews yet, so I thought I'd tell you a little bit about them to make your decision easier.

Bottom line up front: you're going to want to move this to the top of your apartment search list. I will go so far as to say that you can probably go ahead and stop looking now; it really doesn't get any better than this.

Key factors: new, clean, quiet, pet friendly, and a great location (a block from the Metro, and across the street from the DC Circulator and Capital Bikeshare). If you're unfamiliar with DC, this area is booming! New restaurants, shopping, and of course the ballpark is a few blocks away.

The price is comparable to nearly every apartment I looked at in DC, and the amenities are what you would expect from a nice building like this; however, here are some key differences that I noticed during my apartment search: The staff is fantastic! The concierges are great, the maintenance is excellent, and the leasing staff is very friendly! Some of the reviews I read have nothing but bad things to say about their apartment staff. I can't imagine anyone in this building having any problems with the staff. Another negative I often found is the noise complaints. Not here. The typical resident is a young professional type, but there are plenty of other demographics here as well. This is not a party dorm atmosphere, nor are there screaming kids, loud TVs, or wild animals. Sure, you may occasionally hear a dog bark, or the muffled noise of someone watching a movie, but it's normal apartment noise. All that to say: the walls aren't paper thin, and the residents are respectful. 

I would say that of all of the apartments I looked at here in DC, this and Onyx on First (across the street) were the best. The distinguishing factor for me is that Parc Riverside has more square footage in their apartments, and the gym is great!! Go ahead and pocket that money you were considering spending on a gym membership; you won't need it if you chose Parc Riverside.

One last thing: the underground parking is very convenient, but expensive. If you need to keep your car, then you're going to have to pay for parking around here anyway. The garage is a convenient option. If you really don't need a car, you can probably save money and get rid of it. As I mentioned, there's plenty of public transportation around here, and there are always Car2Go rentals parked on the street.

I'd say the only downside is the spelling...but I'm sure you can get past that.

4/9/2004,38086,3.0,"I lived in Riverside Park from 2001 to 2003 before moving closer to the city and work. The apartments themselves are nice. They are huge. My friends were shocked when they came over and saw how much space I had especially considering how little rent I was paying for a large 1 br apt. on the 11th floor. The parking situation is good. I could come in late at night and still find a spot without too much bother. The utilities weren´t too expensive. The maintenance guys themselves were pretty decent. They had a quick turnaround on maintenance issues.  The drawbacks had to do with the maintenance of the property. At some point they switched the cleaning people and the gym started to get rather filthy. The gym itself is rather small but had some decent equipment which was not properly maintained and thus often broken. It´s a real shame considering that the elliptical machine alone cost about $5000 when new. The elevators were always being maintained, which meant that one elevator was always broken. The apartments on the lower floors had a cockroach problem but above the fifth floor it isn´t an issue.  The management doesn´t seem to listen to complaints of people who violate the no-pets clause in the lease. Also, there was graffitti and trash in the elevators.  If you are thinking about living there, you would do well to visit the complex and take a long look around. Maybe take a walk around as well.

The concierges are quite nice, and there is a gym and social room available to residents. If you're lucky enough, you will have a decent sized balcony, and granite countertops. It's close enough to D.C. yet far away enough. Downside which I think overweigh the reason to live here: overpriced and management seems a bit temperamental and non-understanding. Firstly, its overpriced for what you receive. - Thin walls: i can hear my neighbors on either side, and I'm sure they can hear me. - Plaster on the walls have chipped simply by placing a chair up against the wall without anyone leaning on it. - the dishwasher has broken at least twice - the washer has broken at least 3 times - the AC/HEAT went out for no explained reason I had an incident earlier in the year that rendered me unable to gain access to my bank accounts. I called the management well in advance (at least 4 0r 5 days) before rent was due to inform that I was trying to make sure my rent money was transferred to another account that was not frozen (but the bank was unfortunately in another state) and that a check would be mailed. As luck would have it, the check came in a few hours too late. In stead of making an exception (where I had notified and spoken to them several times), they insisted that my rent was late, fined me, made me get a cashiers check which of course had to be sent from out of state! Sure, it was well in their rights to do all of those things, but this is a case where goodwill should have prevailed.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

I could immediately tell there had been a dog living here when I walked in (I've lived with dogs my entire life, so even though the apartment didn't smell bad, I could tell it still had the smell of an dog), and there was LOTS of dog fur along the edges of the carpet. The apartment itself wasn't very clean, but nowhere near filthy. It was disappointing to see lots of poor paint jobs (sloppy lines, painted over dust/dirt, spots on the wood in the bathroom and kitchen). The bathroom floor was pretty dirty, along with the shelves in the closet. But again, these things are really nit-picky, and other than the dog fur I expected most of these type of things when I moved in.

Some quick takes:
-Incredible rooftop with views
-Super friendly and attentive staff
-Nicely decorated interior (blend of modern and traditional)
-Unbeatable location

Coppins Well is the ideal place for residents who love to be in the middle of the action and escape from it just as easily. It's a ten minute walk from downtown on one side and Capitol Hill on the other, and yet far enough away that you never really feel the crowds. The interior is beautiful and has plenty of entertainment space, including a meeting room, a large common room that's free to reserve, and a huge rooftop patio with BBQ grills and plentiful seating.

But perhaps the best part about Coppins Well is the view. From the rooftop you can see Lake Union, downtown, the Space Needle, virtually every mountain in the surrounding area; and because it sits at the edge of downtown (and the start of Capitol Hill's building height restrictions), there isn't much to obscure the sights from behind either. I loved waking up to panoramic views of the snowcapped Cascades throughout the winter (on the occasional clear day, that is)!

And last but not least, I have to give a huge shout-out to building management. Before moving to Seattle I spent four years in Los Angeles, where dealing with renting agencies was a constant battle of mystery charges and crooked leases. I'm pleased to say this was never a problem at Coppins Well. We had a phenomenal relationship with all the folks working here, so much so that by the end of our tenancy we really felt more like neighbors than customers (the way it should be, in my opinion!). On top of that, I've never seen a more attentive staff. Nothing was ever broken down or out of service; everything was consistently clean, functional, and inviting, every day of the year.

3/3/2008,39510,4.0,"I'm not sure what the other people are talking because I have nothing but good things to say about this apartment complex. The reviews I'm reading make it sound like a totally different apartment from where I've been living. Here's my experience: Parking: Parking is what you'd expect for an apartment downtown. The building does have a lot in the back of the building; it's secured and it costs $150 per month. There's a waiting list, though, and so you're more likely to end up in the city parking garage across the street; it's always staffed, and so it, too, is secure. The other option is to park in the neighboring apartment complex's garage, which is also secure. I ended up parking across the street and then after a few month's was offered a parking spot in the building's lot. It's more convenient, for sure, but it's not a deal breaker. Noise: I'm across the hall from the elevator, and so I do hear the elevators occassionally, as well as the people coming and going, but it's nothing severe. Only on very, very rare occasions have I heard my neighbors and I never hear the people upstairs. Aside from the noise in the hallway, the building is sound proof. What's more noisey are the sounds of the city outside (fire engines, police, light rail, etc.), but that is a part of city living. Grounds: The management has worked diligently to keep the grounds clean. They have really started cracking down on pet owners who do not clean up after their pets in the building's parking lot/garage. Other than that, they are always cleaning the common areas. Since we're downtown, there's no landscaping. Safety: This is downtown Baltimore. It's hard to say it's safe or unsafe because it's a city. You basically have to keep your wits about you, but this is the same for any neighborhood in this city. You can pay a lot more money per month and live in Harbor East, which is where I work, but you can't even say that is safe. In terms of inside the building, it's extremely safe. Construction: The building is nice, especially the common areas. The gym is especially great. The management here seems to invest in high quality appliances in the apartments and high quality equipment and furniture in the common areas. Maintenance: On a few occasions, I've had to have maintenance come and inspect problems (sock clogging the washer, a/c not coming on, etc.). They have always, always, always came within 24 hours, but usually within the hour. They're extremely professional and very personable. This is by far the greatest maintenance staff I have encountered in apartment living. Staff: Just as with the maintenance staff, the staff here are incredible. The management is always approachable and willing to work with you on any concerns, questions or issues you have. They throw quarterly happy hours for tenants, and so they get to know you that way. They are eager to know you, too. The maintenance are also personable. The men and women who work security at the front desk are from a different company, but they are professional and extremely personable. They do what is expected, in terms of security, but they also help out with other tasks and always willing to lend you a helping hand when you need it.

Pros: -Location is great, but there are other buildings right near here so it's not a big enough pro to stay. -Maintenance team completes work in a timely matter and are very friendly...unless you have to wait on a response back from the property manager for a part, or plan. - Building is usually pretty clean. -Third party concierge team is great, however their best concierge left at the start of this summer. Our guess is she was tired of having residents yell at her because of the new property manager. Cons: No updates have been done. Items in the amenities are old, dated and broken. - Chairs in the community room have staples coming out of them on the arms - Gym equipment constantly breaks down - Fitness On-Demand doesn't work more than it does work - Coffee is in the club room which you cannot access from 11pm-6am. - We went most of the summer with the front door broken so anyone could get in the building at any time. The building got a new property manager summer of 2017; Emily Wall. - She is never in the office and when she is she always leaves by 4pm. This shouldn't happen as we as residents need to speak with her. Most of us haven't even met her due to her inconsistent schedule. - She places blame on anyone when you call her out on you trying to communicate with her, ""I never got that email"" or ""that was never told to me."" Then when I told her that I personally emailed her and showed her the email on my phone, she replied that it must have gotten deleted during an update. Responding to emails is easier than having to make up lies later. - There was an appointment scheduled for me sit down with Emily to discuss a few issues.

4/24/2017,42849,4.0,"Nice location, fairly quiet, somewhat expensive. PROS: We have lived at West 8 almost 2 years. In general we've really liked it. Maintenance is prompt (it's new construction, so we've mostly called in clearing the tub drain if draino failed). The place has many of the lux gimmes at other spots--beer on tap(during office hours), an auto coffee machine (makes cappuccinos), a microscopic fitness center(2 treadmills, 2 spin bikes), occasionally catered resident events/happy hours, dogwash/bike wash, bike storage. We like that it's across the street from the huge golden community center, has easy access to mountains, is near the bike path and running trails and the community garden. The dishwasher & washer/dryer are high quality. CONS: In some ways, the lux amenities within each apartment are only skin deep. Just touching the varnish on the cabinets seemed like enough to remove it, for instance. The main negative is that rents have gone up 3% every year; don't delude yourself that you won't have to pay more year on year. The 3 bedroom units in particular have high turnover; 4 residents in a year kind of thing. If you need a 3bedroom, it's easier to buy a house than pay 3600$ for an apartment. If you live next to one, expect to see new faces all the time. There are 40$ in monthly mandatory fees for valet trash & pest control. We are planning on moving out this summer into another apartment. We had hoped to move into a house; but will likely postpone until next summer. I have been surprised to find that rates at nearly every other lux complex we looked at 2 years ago outside Golden has declined a bit.

10/31/2017,43039,1.0,"AVOID. I lived in Station House from June 2015 to July 2017. I loved this building in the beginning-- it was brand new and had amazing amenities. But it's been horrifically mis-managed during my time there, and I was relieved to move out at the end of my lease.

- EVERY single person I know that has moved out of this building has been charged upwards of $500 for ""damages."" Good luck getting your deposit back. We received photos of damages that occurred AFTER our move-out. The leasing office stopped responding to my calls and emails and demanded payment within 10 days. Had I the time and energy to fight it, I would have, but it was easier to just write them a check and be done. 

- Since they have trouble filling the building with long term occupants, they've begun renting out to intern housing programs and listing units on sites like hotels.com. The short term people--here for a few nights to a few weeks--treat the place like a hotel and trash it. I cannot tell you how many times I've seen vomit in the elevators and crazy partying in the pool area. It's a shame to pay so much money for the amenities and have them ruined. The young professional crowd that was here when I moved in has fled in droves. 

- Yearly amenity fee. Not just at move in, but every year. I have toured about 25 other buildings in DC that are comparable to SH and have not seen that anywhere else

- Overpriced parking for the neighborhood. None of the EV chargers work except one by the north elevators. Building staff refuses to fix this after 2 years of asking.

- Concierges are mostly unprofessional temp workers from a third party company. Don't expect to see them for more than a few weeks/months. Most are extremely trashy.

- In the two years we lived there, we went through 5 different operations directors and countless leasing agents. Even the staff hates this place...
 
- Constant problems-- our floors had to be replaced due to warping (leaks under our kitchen). Our AC broke 3 times. During our two years, there was also a fire in the building AND the pool flooded from the 7th floor roof all the way down to the lobby. It took 5 months to replace the damage with no compensation from the building or even an apology or work schedule.

9/12/2008,39703,2.0,"Ok - I wrote a semi-positive review of Riverside about 1.5 years ago.. my experience here wasn't the best, but it wasn't *awful*, and I felt justified in defending the management/maintenance/property/whatever. Ok, here's the deal: Riverside is getting increasingly '------' with each year. Maintenance: the first few months we lived here, maintenance was beyond excellent, incredibly timely in their response, and even left cute little notes with Lifesavers attached to them when they completed a request. Now, you'll be lucky if they respond at all. (I'm serious as a heart attack - they are just as apt to mark an online request 'closed' without *ever even contacting you* [or even less visiting the apartment to take a look!] as they are to fix it. For instance, they have left a HUGE hole, covered with cardboard and duct tape, in our wall for months now; it's from a time when they had to repair some plumbing behind the wall. I've begged them to fix it probably five or six times online, and they continue to blow it off.) They seem to be employing a lower tier of maintenance guys lately, too - like another reviewer said, even if they *do* ""fix"" a problem, it's going to likely need to be 'refixed.' Management: Ok, I used to think all the complaints about bogus charges, etc., were from sleazy renters who had skipped out on some payment/service fee/whatever, or actually damaged something inside their property and were reluctant to pay for it. WRONG - at least these days. We're going to be moving out in a month (thank goodness), we tend to pay our rent days or even weeks PRIOR to the due date (even one of the guys on the management staff, Boris, who's actually ok, said we were like ideal renters) - my husband and I are both professionals (an auditor and an archivist) who take financial stuff, credit, personal integrity, etc. very, very, very seriously. Ok. Today we got a letter about a totally random, bogus fee (my husband knows more about this than I do, but apparently the woman he paid our final rent to - a scary individual named Trac(e?)y - told him he wouldn't owe some $300 fee that's normally charged when renters switch to month to month, as we did a few months prior because we had started house-hunting and didn't know when we'd find something). The bill is for $530!!! (The bogus $300 that we supposedly DIDN'T OWE - I hope my husband got this in writing - plus a $230 ""late fee""!!!) I come from a very clean-cut, honest, upper-middle-class Midwestern background, and I honestly think this is the sleaziest, nastiest, weirdest apartment complex I've ever lived in. Maybe it goes with the region - I used to rent back in Missouri and Chicago when I was single, and it was always just a straightforward, positive, normal experience. I'm editing this review because I just acquired some new info: the bogus $300 fee wasn't for switching to month-to-month, as I originally speculated; it was some sort of ""move-out fee."" (And, no, we didn't break our lease or anything like that.) And, GET THIS: They will ONLY accept payment by cashiers check or money order - in other words, nothing that there will be a paper trail documenting.

However the big issue that makes me want you to discourage anyone from getting an apartment here is we have a ""pot problem.""  The smell of Marijuana has just ruined the appeal of the place.  While the staff have been nothing but friendly to me, it seems that they can't get control of the marijuana situation.  I have complained multiple times to management and have also gotten the police involved as well and we still have this problem.

UPDATE:  After having the Falls Church City Police come out and assess the situation they were able to document the situation, and without getting into to many details they are working closer with management and I am confident that this will be resolved soon.  My original review gave it 3 stars, I have updated it to 4 stars because my experience with the staff, despite what others have said the staff have been responsive to me, they just haven't had the ability to enforce the policies that will abate the problem.  

Now that they are working closely with the police I am more confident, which leads me to another aspect of this apartment complex that I forgot to mention in my original review.  It is in Falls Church City not Fairfax County.  That means we have an entire Police Department and Sheriffs Office that is responsible for a town that is less than 2 square miles.

We had to go in to find out about new package pick-up rules, plans for kitchen renovations, and the manager´s office hours.

All I can say is maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. The facade of the all three buildings is falling apart with pieces of concrete sitting on the air conditioners as you look down off your balcony and on the ground when you get to ground-level. The elevators are unreliable and the air conditioners constantly break down and do not regulate the temperatures consistently. The power and water situation at Riverside is abominable. The power often goes out at the hint of a storm and the water has been shut off several times since we moved in.  A final item I must mention is the lack of security. Yes, there is a guard at the front gate, but they let anyone through who has some reason to be there. I´ve witnessed 3 arrests since I moved in 8 months ago.

It was the 2nd management group I\'ve rented from in DC and the 4th apartment I lived in during my time in the District. Of all the apartments I\'ve lived in, in The Apollo/Bozzuto was the only one I RENEWED my lease with. \nIn 3.5 years, I moved apartments 4 times. Not because I like moving or can\'t make up my mind, but because I expect some level of comfort for the amount of money that it costs to rent in DC. Before moving into The Apollo, I toured 3 other competitors in the neighborhood and saw plenty of apartments. Before that, I lived on 14th Street in a building managed by a competitor (won\'t name) but it was run like an ASU college dorm (no offense ASU Alumn). \nThat said, The Apollo was by far the best apartment building & management group that I experienced. From the beginning, the management team put up with my ""shop around"" character flaw. They were friendly, on point, timely, considerate and actually cared. Without the slightest sign of annoyance, they showed me 5-6 apartments before I selected one. \nThe building itself is beautiful and has some amazing amenities. (See website) The whole place is run more like a hotel than an apartment building. Antenia at the front desk rocks my world. She. The. Best. The management team was always helpful, followed up on any questions/concerns and took care of the residents\' needs. They went above and beyond for me on several occasions. \nThe community within the building was also a surprise plus. 99.9% of the residents are friendly, outgoing and great neighbors. \nI hope that a review from an EX-resident serves as a huge testament to just how amazing this place is. I only left The Apollo because I moved out of state. Take my word on this - if I moved back to DC - I\'d move back into The Apollo without a doubt. \n\n#8\r\n                            ']",1.0,Gold,63.0,5.0,1.0

9/13/2015,42260,5.0,"So I wanted to wait until I lived here for at least a month before writing a review. I am in the 601 building (the phase 2 building as they call it in the leasing office) and I picked the apartment based on positive reviews. I am a young, single girl with a dog and I am VERY particular about where I live, especially when it comes to cleanliness and safety. Overall, I love living here and I am very happy with my choice; however, I have yet to pay any utility bills since I have only lived here a month, so that is something to consider when reading this review. Any time I have dealt with any of the staff, they have been extremely polite and helpful. This building is very pricey, but with what you get, it is much better than a lot of other places I looked at that were not much cheaper. You really get what you pay for.

Apartment itself-I rent a 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment for $2700/mo. Upon moving in, the apartment was immaculately clean and I even searched the bathroom for any uncleanliness and could not find it. Moving in was super easy since we were able to use the service elevator. They give you a 4 hour time slot to move in, but they do not actually regulate it so it isn't super strict. The dishwasher, washer/dryer and all of the appliances are new and working well. the cabinets in the kitchen are a tad cheap looking compared to the beautiful granite countertops, but they are fine. Also the stove is electric and I would prefer gas, but not a huge deal.

The building-601 Holland is great. The building is always extremely clean and the outside is superbly kept. A few tiny complaints that do not really bother me but might bother some. First, the elevator always seems to be sort of dirty. There is free coffee/tea in the lobby and there is constantly coffee spilled on the floor. There are staff that clean the floors every day but it is always still coffee stained. Also, I have a dog and I pick up after her whenever she poops outside. People do clean up after their dogs for the most part, but I wouldn't advise walking across any of the lawns because there are the lazy pet owners who leave poop on the grass (or the sidewalk) which I do not understand. Another thing about pets...if you do not like dogs, do not live here. Seriously there are dogs everywhere. I have a dog so I do not mind. But if you do not like dogs, this is not the place for you.

Amenities-The amenities are great. Residents have access to 501 and 601 so we have two pools, two gyms, a rooftop terrace, and lots of lovely outdoor seating areas. The gyms and pools are always very clean and well-kept. There are also grills which I have yet to use but people are using them all of the time, and the staff cleans them very regularly.

Safety-This is one of the main reasons I picked this building. The area is great-there are always people walking around, even at night, and I have never felt unsafe while walking my dog at night. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the King Street metro station which is super convenient, and the building is also only a few minutes to walk to Whole Foods, 7/11, starbucks, panera, jimmy johns, potbelly, a nice salon and a dry cleaners. There are also a bunch of restaurants and a USPS on the same street as the building. To enter any of the elevators or doors of the building, you have to use a key fob, which can get annoying at times but is a nice safety feature. I have a parking spot (unreserved) which I pay $75 a month for, and I have never had trouble finding a spot (even with my enormous SUV). You can pay $125 for a reserved spot but it really isn't necessary unless you drive everywhere. I barely ever use my car though. Also, the building is only 1 mile from old town which is a great area full of restaurants and shops. 

Overall, I have no big complaints about this building. It is extremely pricey...but is a great clean, safe building in a great area, so I don't mind paying more to live here.",1.0,Certified,47.0,5.0,1.0

Slight downside I guess is that the floors are not real wood and so they scratchy easily.

1/4/2019,43469,2.0,"I could basically copy/paste Anthony W's review. When I moved across the country to San Diego in July 2018, my main criteria for living was a nice building with amenities. Before I signed my lease I was told the pool and fitness center would be open in August 2018 with the rest of the amenities being open in early 2019. Well, it is January 2019 and the pool is still not opened, the fitness center just opened a couple weeks ago, and the rest of the amenities do not seem to be anywhere close to ready. Oh, and I was told AFTER I signed my lease that the rooftop lounge is only accessible to certain floors (this rule was NOT in the lease). When moving into a high rise tower, one would assume you could enjoy the rooftop lounge unless told otherwise. Not to mention the dust in the parking garage that causes my car to be filthy after a few days.

In addition, this large tower downtown does not even have an address registered. When you type in 100 Park Plaza or Park 12 in any GPS, it will take you to PETCO Park (100 Park Blvd). How a huge high rise tower downtown doesn't have an address 6 months after opening is unbelievable.
 
Finally, management has been extremely inconsistent with their updates of the progress and reasoning for all of these issues. A 6 month construction delay is significant, and the inability to provide a specific reason and/or somewhat accurate timeline is ridiculous. The people are nice and say they are doing everything they can, but nothing actually gets done. I can sum it up best by saying that this is NOT what I signed up for when I moved across the country, and feel VERY mislead.

You can hear EVERYTHING through the ""extra-thick"" apartment walls. If someone drops the toilet seat in the apartment next door, you can hear it in your apartment. Every unit has ""move-in"" issues because they have no quality assurance checks. This is the equivalent of updating your iPhone software before it is bug-tested, and you become the bug-tester. The list goes on. The complete opposite of exclusivity and luxury. It's run more a kin to a college dorm than a concierge high-end apartment. Security companies have been changed multiple times and are patrolling each floor, due to the ongoing construction, stopping tenants for identification as if you are in a jail. More a kin to the Gestapo than a tenant-oriented security agency. Management is obviously investor driven focused on sales results, not tenant retention.

11/30/2016,42704,4.0,"I toured this building on their grand opening day. It was quite a party.  Drinks, barbecue, live music, massages etc. What not to like but I had mixed feelings about the building and really had to think about it.  The design and architecture of this building is so different from any other building it made me go hmmmm. 

This is a mixed housing building. A portion of this building is dedicated to local worker housing at a discounted rate I was told.  The leasing staff was extremely nice and had great customer service.  Jaime showed us around. 

First off, there is no parking in this area and you would really need to have parking under the building if you were to live here and had a vehicle.  

From a distance the exterior architecture strikes me as very dark and almost gothic.  The windows appear black as if you couldn't see through them from the inside but you can.  Balcony space is almost nonexistent at this building and the balconies that do exist are very odd shaped, small and almost unusable. 

I have toured almost every new apartment building or condo in the Portland Metro area in the last three years. The trend is the units are becoming smaller and rent for a higher price. This building is no different. 

We toured the penthouse floor first and I failed to see any ""wow"" factor in their penthouse units. I thought they were way overpriced per square foot and I'm sure that the rent pricing will be reduced after it's been open awhile. Just like other new buildings.  I will say the one cool thing about the penthouse floor is they have their own lounge/bar and so on. 

The finishes/materials were mid range nothing, special.  The majority of the units have dark gray/black bathrooms and the fixtures are dark except for the toilet which is white...very odd. The kitchens are gray with a chrome back splash. 

It was warm outside the day we toured and the HVAC units were extremely noisy in the units... Very noticeable. 

On the City side, the views were absolutely spectacular from the units. Looking out over the city, the Willamette in the Portland Oregon sign really screamed PDX.  Very nice!  

There are a lot of amenities in this building including an extremely beautiful full service spa and a full gym which make it desirable. There is also going to be a Tilt restaurant and some sort of brewery along with other retailers.  With all this you wouldn't even need to leave.  

Go check it out... I'd love to hear what others think",1.0,Silver,51.0,4.0,1.0

2/10/2018,43141,1.0,"Lived here for a year, and I'm going to make this as honest as I can.

Pros:
--Beautiful, modern and new apartments
--Super thick walls so you never hear your neighbors
--Ample parking if you pay for it
--Swimming pool which is nice and well kept
--Nice neighborhood area pushed back off the main road
--Lake Artemesia right down the street (great evening walks)
--Movie theater and grocery store in the mall next door
--Good 495 access
--Great club room
--24 hour gym with a decent variety of equipment
--Maintenance is responsive

Cons: 
--They bungled our move in discount, resulting in a rent payment $300/month more than what we agreed to. I feel mislead and scammed--be wary of the move in discount and make sure you have a very clear understanding of how it works. It's not just for that day as it says in the office but a standing move-in incentive, so don't feel pressured to sign.
--People smoke on their balconies due to weak enforcement of the no-smoking policy.
--You are required to pay $25/mo for trash concierge. It does not include recycling other than than collapsed cardboard boxes, so you still have to take out the recycling anyway.
--The parking garage is not secure and non-residents regularly park in spaces assigned to residents.
--While there is guest parking, it is all used by residents who don't want to pay for parking.
--Literally right next to train tracks (we're talking like 50 feet)--make sure you stay in an apartment long enough to hear a train go by when touring to see if you can live with it.
--A mile away from the metro ""as the crow flies"". Definitely not walkable, but I think there's a shuttle.
--Construction on apartments feel rushed (we've had to reattach our dryer vents a few times, windows have come out of their tracks, etc) so I doubt this place will be in good shape after more than a few years of wear and tear. The materials used are super cheap and the paint is already peeling after 1 year here.
--On that note, the windows are SUPER inefficient. Our utility bill is far higher than my last place because the windows and sliding door let in so much cold air from outside.
--Their lease language is rock solid. You can't break it for almost any reason (including job loss or death).
--If you order food (Blue Apron/Hello Fresh) don't count on getting it in time. The office staff doesn't email you for a few days if it gets left with them, so by the time they let you know all the food is spoiled.

We'll finish out the year due to their ironclad lease language but we won't be renewing due to the cost, the handling of the move in discount and the myriad other problems with living here. Nice enough place, which is earning it the one star that I gave it, but poorly run and not at all worth $2500/month for rent + utilities in a 1080 sq ft.",1.0,Gold,63.0,1.0,0.0

I AGREE COMPLETELY with the last posting about the package room though. It used to be a Nightmare to get packages but since the girl has taken over it has been GREAT!! She even extended the hours so now they are open until 8:00PM. The maintenance is VERY quick!! They get everything done at least by the next day which in my opinion is great!! They even unclogged my toilet at 10:00 one night!! And when I locked myself out they were there within 15 minutes. They just installed new cameras and they have switched to a key fob system in order to get in the building. They have a great shuttle bus system that I used almost daily to get to the metro station. They even run 2 busses in the morning now so that more people can use it! On Saturdays they will take you to the grocery store and the public bus stops right in front of the gates!!

1/5/2019,43470,1.0,"I've lived in apartments and rented my whole life and this was by far the worst experience I've ever had start to finish. I just finished a 2 year lease. First of all ask the leasing agent when the elevator was replaced in the building you are looking at. I had the unfortunate pleasure of going through the replacing experience. Long story short about a year of only one working at a time and occasionally having to take the stairs from the 14th floor, long wait times, and dealing with angry neighbors. It's like riding the bus. Several times the one that was working would go out. Things were constantly falling apart in the unit. The main closet collapsed in my unit 3 times! Every time the maintenance people would say, ""it looks like the last guy did a bad job"". They are nice enough but don't seem to be trained very well. Packages - By far the biggest headache here. Do not be fooled by the Luxor system, it's always a complete mess. The delivery drivers may leave your packages in 3 different locations on the property, none of which are your front door. Expect to be chasing mail around. over 2 years I had roughly 7 packages stolen or ""lost"" here. Every time you need anything from the office staff they say, ""Oh So and so needs to answer that question and they are conveniently out to lunch"". This happend to me countless times including the simple question of ""what is my final rent amount"" - This took 3 staff members to figure out and about 45 mins of my day. They charge you a cleaning fee when you move out if the unit is not ""market ready"". My unit wasn't even market ready when I took possession. The vinyl floor was ripped and there was a huge candle burn in one the cabinets that took them 2 months to replace. My carpet wasn't new and had visible signs of wear and tear. On top of the couple hundred dollar cleaning fee they ended up hitting me for an extra $100 or so of my deposit with no notes or explanation. I called and they said (as you may have guessed from the previous passage), ""Oh so and so needs to answer that and she's out, I'll transfer you to her voicemail"". I left a message and got no reply whatsoever.

If we had a maintenance issue the management was prompt in resolving it.

Sopheary was a great leasing consultant - she took us to see specific apartments that we had requested but also listened to our needs and thoughtfully recommended other great floorplans. After spending the past week looking at apartments, we were prepared to ask a million questions and leave no stone unturned. Sopheary was well prepared with answers to all of our questions which was very helpful.

The property itself is gorgeous - the finishings are incredibly stylish and contemporary. I particularly enjoyed the floor-to-ceiling windows and the large pool deck. Everything is so new and sparkling clean.

We did start the application process for Alina and were very close to signing a lease here but ultimately made the decision to live in a mid-rise building as opposed to this high-rise building, but this was not due to any fault or shortcoming of Alina itself.

Here´s a recap of my numerous adventures:  In 1995, while washing my car someone stole my bag which contained my keys. Later that evening that individual broke into my apartment with the aid of then security department. The individual called the security department and claimed that he was a tenant and that he was out of the country for the past six months and forgot which parking space was his. The individual read the numbers from the black access card to the security guard and the guard informed the individual of my parking spot, he also gave the individual my apartment number!!! Of course you can imagine the rest. First he broke into my car and then the idiot came to my apartment. I was lucky enough to chase the guy out. The individual was later arrested and found that he was a previous guard at the Fillmore Center. I should have moved out at that time but I didn´t.  After a while, you get used to the gun shot, loud music and everything else but the customer service of the building management is the worst by far. About two years ago, a pipe broke in the laundry room in my tower. The pipes would bang against my bedroom walls all night. I called and complained numerous times and finally it was fixed three weeks after it started. Now the sound is back and I don´t even want to guess how long it´s going to be before they fix it.

5/30/2002,37406,2.0,"My boyfriend and I live at Falkland Chase for the convenience to the red line and his office (a 5 min. walk away). The ""charm"" of the apartment is definitely not what is keeping us there. The apartments were built before building codes, so be wary. Both of the cable outlets in our house are on walls where you couldn´t fit a TV even if the electrical outlet weren´t 10 feet and a door away from it (One is behind a door and one is in a small nook, originating in our pantry)! There is NO vent in the bathroom, which is very challenging considering these cement apartments hold in every bit of moisture. In the winter, the single-paned windows will drive you crazy - each morning I had to remove about 2-3 cups of water from the sill or watch the windows turn moldy. On the plus side when I called maintenance about it, they sent someone to bleach and repaint all of the windows and offered to bring us a dehumidifier - unfortunately, we were out of electrical outlets! Maintenance has generally been OK, but the office staff is pathetic. Within the first week, they rented our storage unit to someone else. To top it off, they make you turn in your driver´s license to get the key to the storage areas. Since we don´t have a car, we had rented a pick-up to move some things to the storage unit. They gave us the wrong key to the unit before closing for the weekend (which we didn´t know until the truck was paid for and loaded). The next time we went to get the key (on a Saturday) there was one person in the office (five of us in line) and we waited about 30 minutes even though he knew we just needed our key. When he finally got to us, their records were so bad that he didn´t know which unit was ours (we weren´t taking any chances) and just gave us all of the keys. (We´ve since made copies). My biggest complain has got to be the lack of telephone and electrical outlets, as well as the fact that they are always on opposite sides of the room (a challenge for computers, Tivo, answering machines and cordless phones). The humidity and window condensation, the few and distant laundry facilities, poor management and TINY closets (one is so small that the door won´t shut if you actually put something on a hanger!) are not far behind.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

I would usually wait to review but I figured anyone looking for an apartment might benefit from hearing a recent renter's experience. So far everything is really great. The leasing team is really amazing and some of the friendliest people I have met. After being approved for my unit, I had about a month before my actual move in date. Chris, my leasing agent, was so kind in keeping in touch and letting me come in to see the unit I was going into even before I was ready to move in. I ended up changing my mind on the initial unit I was going to because I wanted a balcony. I just knew someone would be annoyed but…not at all! Not only were they accommodating to my switch but they turned the paperwork around the same day. When I moved in (on a Wednesday) it was a breeze, I handed over my paperwork and got my keys. The apartment is really beautiful and spacious for me. The hallways are generally kept clean but every now and then you'll see a piece of trash lingering. But that's more on the residents and not the building as a whole. Other reviewers have mentioned noise and there are some valid points with that. I do hear loud footsteps and children running a couple times a day but honestly that's a price for apartment living. I'm not too sensitive to noise so it doesn't really bother me at all.

The property manager has no respect for the tenants that live in the building. The building manager and inadequate maintenance workers (specifically David Molina) blame and harass tenants without any evidence of claims. My apartment is always flooded, incurring random damages due to lack of maintenance and help, and Galina and her staff never listen or take responsibility for this gross lack of respect for tenant need, or accommodate any demands. When maintenance comes and pretends to fix or look for a solution for anything amiss in the apapartment it always is in effort to find some type of tenant liability with the issue, and they are quick to place blame. I have not had floor in my apartment for a week and this is the second time this has occurred with little to no resolution or any concession. A normal property manager would do something about this and give lower rent for the month and understand how frustrating it is to live in a hazardous space with no floor, multiple holes in the wall, industrial fans that stay operating affecting our ability to sleep at all hours of the day/night, continual flooding and leaks that they refuse to identify the cause for, and such lack of empathy.

My laundry machine also broke down and they failed do anything about it, and I was forced to wait a week to do my laundry and again with no assistance or understanding from Adaire management staff or management team. My car as well as my girlfriend's car have also gotten towed multiple times from the parking garage, both vehicles already having been registered on the lease, with permits, yet when we reported this to them, we were still not met with any understanding or compensation for our trouble and their $500 mistake.

Additionally, the maintenance team does not know how to fix anything in the building itself. There have been so many cases of flooding, leaks (with our neighbors), elevators breaking, and the building garage door has been broken for almost 8 months. I have never seen this awful level of customer service or lack of care before in my life.

The building looks beautiful from outside but before you rent here don't let the Adaire Management Team fool you. They don't care about their residents or how the apartment is left like trash for weeks because of various incidents that they are fail to take responsibility for.

I never write reviews and this is how bad Adaire has become under Galina. She runs the building so very poorly. Additionally, the coffee machine is always broken.

Good luck trying to talk about it with the leasing agents, unless you are up for renewal and then they MAY try and work with you.
  

Dog friendly community but you hear barking all day through the walls. They sold us on the amenity of a fire place in the community area and 2 years later and huge turnover in the leasing office and the fire place STILL does not work. With varied excuses there is still no projected fix date. There are only 4 elevators for this huge building and it took OVER 2 months to fix the broken elevator on the east end of the building to work. 

Concierge in the lobby is not consistent, stepping away for and hour or two at a time. This property would work great for people that don't have cars as there are plenty of bicycle storage spots. If you need to park a car or two, be repaired to spend $90 a month per car. I have never rented at a place that has as strict visitor rules as this property.

The facilities are wonderful, valet parking, a pool, community areas (with fire place, TVs and pool table), roof terras, bbq terras, it is all very very nice. 

But what makes this place truly great is the staff. Hence I will give a shout out to them first:
Everyone is super nice and extremely helpful. The concierges are always greeting you, and they are always there if you need something and available 24/7. The leasing office staff are also extremely nice, they might not always be there (as the office is only open during office hours) but they will get back with you asap if you have questions. The cleaning staff is really nice too and they work really hard to keep the place super clean (so many people and dogs in the building but you wouldn't say it by how spotless it is kept). The valet people are also super nice and helpful and do their best to get you car quickly, and make sure your car (and motorcycle; as I have one as well) is kept under good care, they can even wash it for you and put air in your tires if needed. I don't talk much to the mail people but when I do they are definitely very nice, and I love having people receive my packages and notifying me or even deliver to my unit if I want when I have a delivery, I do know they work hard to get everything through in time. As for technical staff: I had to put in a couple work orders (my dryer, and the light in the hallway) and it was taken care really quickly. You can even do all this over the app they have. So though I didn't talk to them, I was very pleased with their work. Last but definitely not least: I use the gym regularly, and attend many classes every week; and the trainers are a blast and very skilled, I love their classes. The classes are complimentary and the gym is of high grade; enough machines and all very new and well kept.

(I noticed a few one star reviews from people that complain about one issue but love the rest of the place. A bit weird to use Yelp as a message board as everyone at Nema is super approachable I have noticed. And again: no I am not told to write this for Nema, check out my profile, I honestly feel that way about living here.)

I definitely want to point out a few other great things about this building: it is super quiet. I live on the street side, but when I close my sliding door (balcony) it is quiet. They did a great job sound proofing! I also hardly hear my neighbors. Besides from every now and then maybe a door that closes in the hallway, I don't hear anything. And believe me: I am picky when it comes to noise.
Regularly Nema organizes events for the residents that are either free to attend, or at a really good price point. In the 3 months I have been here I have seen a few roll by: movie nights (with drinks and a popcorn machine), art walks in the city, happy hours at a trendy local bar, wine tastings in wine country (with shuttle), a live jazz band with drinks and bites, ski trips, brewery tours etc. All the events I have attended were a lot of fun! It is a great way to get to know fellow residents.

As for the neighborhood: a couple blocks away it is pretty bad at night. But except for the one straggler here and there the streets right around Nema are not too bad. As you can see I am a woman, I own two small dogs and I take them out even after 10pm or around 11pm. I also go out every now and then and take public transportation, even late at night (if I have to go through the bad part at night, I do take Lyft instead) and I have never felt unsafe. I noticed one lady complaining in her review about her dog relief notices and blaming it on not being able to get it out due to the bad neighborhood: ignore her. The streets right around the building are fine, especially when you stay in sight of the concierge. Nema also cleans the streets around the building so I am not sure why she talks about crap and needles(?). They clean and hose down the streets every day.

If I would want to see one thing improved it is the dog run. They clean it every day (hosing it down) but due to it being in the shade 24/7 and having no (or at least very bad) drainage, hosing it off just makes it more pissy and the pissy water just doesn't clear. It smells really bad 24/7 even when you just walk past (which I do daily). I used it once and had to throw away my shoes because I couldn't get the piss smell off. It would be good if they improve the drainage underneath it. Or perhaps move the doggy run to one of the roofs so it can get some sun to dry out (even on the roof it should still have drainage).",1.0,Silver,51.0,5.0,1.0

This building located in the heart of Seattle. And this is totally true! I'm always like to wake up in the morning and in 1-2 minutes drink my favorite coffee in the First Starbucks, then go to the French Bakery for some macaroons and buy a local fruits, veges, seafood and raw milk from Farmers. This is 2 blocks from Viktoria! 
If you will come in our lobby you always found our concierges very friendly, smiling and happy to work here! All of this people so interesting! I like to chat with them ) They are also can give you a good advice about beautiful place in Seattle to visit if you are new in this city!
We have 24/7 service to get your packages. This is so good if you working too late and don't have a  n opportunity go to the office in their work hours. 
Elevators. They are always working!! All three!!! I remember 2-3 times when one of the elevators wasn't work. Btw I live here for more than 2 years. 
Rooftop. We have a gorgeous rooftop!!(you can see it in the pictures). Our landlord always trying to keep this place clean, but we  have some people who don't want to follow building rules. But they are in all buildings! Our community every day sending a reminders about our rules, and after that it getting better. This is about that people who don't leashed their big dogs. I have a little baby and it can be scary if your elevator is opening and a HUGE HAPPY DOG is trying to make you happy)))) I'm totally agree with our management that if you have a dog you need to respect other people who don't like them(especially if you have allergy or little baby, who can be scared to death). 
And now about apartments. Quality of the apartments is truly luxury. Hard floors, huge windows and... My favorite part of this... AC!!!! If you don't have A/C in your apartments at summertime or if you live in the South and East- omg... You will have a big problem! Because Windows is real huge, all the sunlight will be warm your house. 
You can pay your rent online! Yahoo!! 
Also we have a theater in the 9th floor when you can watch your favorite films on the big screen!

2/20/2018,43151,1.0,"Well, from a guest's perspective, the apartment itself is pretty nice, but that's about where the positive ends.

As others have noted as far back as 2015, it's pretty rare for all of the elevators to actually be working.  Given that there are only two elevators and 19 floors per side, this means you are going be waiting a long time to actually get to your apartment.  At one point there was only one elevator working, and it was on the other side of the building.  It could literally take ten minutes to get from the parking garage to your apartment.  

Speaking of the parking garage, I hope you don't plan on having people over, because you're only allowed one guess permit, and there's nowhere else to park in the area.  There's a good chance you won't even get the one permit, because there are only about 20 spots for 19 floors of people.  God help you if don't have a pass or forget to display it properly, because you will definitely get towed (all the way to Merrifield to add insult to injury).  What about the almost completely empty third level of the garage? No, you'll get towed from there, too.

The people at the front desk are usually helpful and friendly, but they don't write the building policies.  A friendly person letting you know that your guest's car was towed doesn't really take the sting out.  This place is expensive, even for Tysons.  You'd think that extra cost would at least make management want to make life in the building as hassle free as possible.  Instead, even just visiting the place is a huge chore.",1.0,Gold,62.0,1.0,0.0

6/9/2007,39242,3.0,"The Peninsula is a newer building on Columbia Point in Dorchester across the street from Harbor Point. Its a pretty good building with alot of amenities. Gym is tiny but definitely better than nothing. The pool is nice to look at but I feel that it was closed more than it was open this summer (including many 90 degree days and all of Labor Day weekend). The building is made up with a good amount of young professionals, some families, but mostly a lot of UMass-Boston kids. They are for the most part pretty good but you do have the bad apples getting drunk and destroying parts of the property (exit signs, holes in walls, etc). The drawbacks include the location; it is kind of in the middle of nowhere (down the end of Mt. Vernon St.), this makes getting downtown kind of a pain in the --- (10-15 min walk to red line, or get lucky and sync up to the erratic bus schedule). Also, parking situation is more than a little irksome. Current policy only allows for 1 parking spot (even if you are in a 2 bedroom apt with each roommate having a car). Very frustrating considering the location of the building. If you are lucky enough to get a coveted permit you can have the privilege of paying $50 a month for it. $50 is a little steep for the area (Dorchester) considering the rest of Dorchester has a resident parking program when you can get a permit from the city and park for free. As a side note, across the street at Harbor Point (owned by the same management company) parking is free and there are no limits on residents. It is tough to live here without a car. The office staff is decent, but mostly tries to treat you like they are doing you a favor when you go to pick up packages (its one of the amenities they offer to claim it is a 'luxury' building, mostly to charge more in rent) or try ask them any kind of questions. Overall, a pretty good place to live but a little bit overpriced for being in the location where it is. I personally am definitely not renewing.

3/7/2008,39514,2.0,"I have lived at Capitol Park Towers for nearly two years. The apartment complex is ideal for a 20-something, low-maintenance tenant looking to save a few bucks while living in DC; nonprofiteers and public servants looking to live alone should step to the front of the line. I found the apartment building conveniently located near two metro stations (L'Enfant Plaza and Federal Center SW; if you work on Capitol Hill you could walk to your office in 15-20 minutes). Unfortunately, there are very few restaurants in the area. There's one dilapidated Safeway that charges way too much for less-than-stellar groceries. On the weekend the area is extremely quiet, which is nice if you like to escape the urban pace while still being close to all the action. There is one Gold's Gym located nearby that is open 7 days a week. The neighborhood is in the process of being heavily gentrified - renovations to the Waterfront Mall and Arena Stage are taking place presently. The arrival of the National's Stadium has sparked the construction of too many luxury condos, businesses catering to these condo dwellers (like Harris Teeter, Starbucks, shopping centers, etc), and more traffic and parking problems. Much of this neighborhood ""growth"" is displacing many families who have lived in the area for generations. The management of the building is TERRIBLE. If you are a low-maintenance tenant, this should not be a problem, however, if you require a lot of on-site support, DO NOT MOVE HERE. My time in the building was relatively uneventful. I was fortunate to live on the sixth floor, so many of the ROACH and RAT problems did not affect my floor (though I have heard unconfirmed rumors that a RAT was found in my neighbors closet down the hall). I have to admit that this discovery was one of the main motivators to move -- I also have a really great partner who I like spending a lot of time with;-). I have not been impressed with the management s customer service during the very few times I have interacted with this staff. For example, I had a gas leak in my apartment. Naturally I concerned by the situation. I contacted the security office downstairs who said that it wasn t a problem and that I shouldn t worry. He said it was at my discretion to call the fire department. Fortunately, I m a bit handy and fixed the pilot light issue inside the oven. I did call the fire department and had them double check my apartment to make sure it was safe for not only my unit, but for the entire building! I was amazed by the management s lack of concern there are other examples, but my fingers are starting to get tired critiquing the staff. They really are disengaged from the entire process. Currently, I m in the process of moving out, and I seem to be spending my days managing the staff to process the necessary legal paperwork and appraisal appointments to terminate my lease in order to receive (fingers crossed) my security deposit back. I plan to write another review after my exit to let others know how this process actually goes. I'm not holding my breath, but my apartment has been well taken care of over the past two years. If I get my security deposit back in full, I'll be very surprised. Another review may be forthcoming. The bottom line; RENTER BEWARE.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm so glad I was introduced to the Avalon family, because now I feel like I'll never live anywhere else! My boyfriend and I just moved into Avalon Mission Bay, but it's worth looking back and writing a few notes about AVA 55 Ninth for those considering this as a place of residence.

First and foremost, it's NOT in the best neighborhood. I'll try to convince friends that it's NOT the Tenderloin, but many of them know better. Homeless people right around the corner. Smelly, gross streets. BUT it's so close to the Civic Center BART station. Convenient, yet I wouldn't want to go out for a leisure walk. This is the primary reason we chose not to renew a lease here.

The actual apartments are fantastic. Great amenities, including a spacious kitchen and in-unit washer and dryer. The restrooms for my boyfriend's apartment had sliding wooden doors. Not ideal, but they had great ventilation, on the bright side. Mirrors miraculously didn't fog up during hot showers. Also, plenty of storage/shelve space around the apartment, namely the bathroom and kitchen.

Depending on your apartment, beautiful views of city hall. The sunsets and sunrises are incredible. Back to amenities, there's a well-equipped 2nd floor gym, enough for what I need, though my boyfriend wishes there was more variety in equipment. Next door to the gym, there's an awesome indoor common space (with two small offices) and outdoor picnic and BBQ areas that can be used for friend get-togethers. No reservations allowed or needed for the most part. 

The biggest annoyance is the slow elevators, which services the whole building. The biggest blessing, however, is how wonderful the staff members are. Even when I'm working from the 2nd floor common space, the staff members taking out the trash will say hello.

I lived in one of the penthouses which was quite nice actually it had a fireplace, a decent sized kitchen, two bedrooms and two bathrooms and three balconies. The rent was astronomical. The maintenance was actually pretty good, our toilet and dishwasher went on the blink and they were fixed within 24 hours. Parking is expensive and sometimes the parking gate is broken but they get it fixed right away. In a complex of this size you sometimes have to walk quite a ways from your car to your apartement, well it's no exception here but you really don't want to park on the street in this neighborhood. Okay, the neighborhood...everything that people have said about the neighborhood is absolutely true. Gunshots, sirens, crime, it's like a war zone in the western addition. I saw someone get mugged on Fillmore, right in front of the office in broad daylight, even though there's a police station right down the street. Drug dealing openly goes on in this neighborhood, you can see them handing out little plastic bags to people who stop for their fix. It's absolutely disgusting and demoralizing. Don't let your parents visit you here, rent a motel for them on Lombard or south city. And wear your running shoes if you ever have to walk on the sidewalks around here, particularly to the safeway across the way and for god's sake don't go out after dark. Management ignores your calls after you sign the lease, they don't want anything to do with you. In all fairness they probably deal with difficult tenants all day long so they just assume that you're going to be difficult as well, so they harden themselves into ice cold unreasonable robots in order to deal. Fair enough, I guess I'd be unhappy too if I had such a crappy job.

Got assigned to a leasing agent called Kenny, who patiently showed me around a few apartments and the amenities of the property. Long story short; finally a place that I can call home (away from home). Perfectly sized brand new apartment, top notch appliances, great view, no afternoon sun, free coffee and happy hour on Fridays (who can resist free food???).

Anyway, I came back again on a Saturday afternoon (the very next day actually) to confirm my booking (without an appointment!) The office was swarmed, and Kenny apologetically told me that he couldn't tend to me immediately, and if I could come back at 530pm. I did, and when I came back, I requested to look at the apartment one last time, and decided to book it there and then. By the time I completed the transaction and walked out of there it was almost 630pm. It was then that I saw that they actually closed at 5 on Saturdays. Throughout the whole time I was there, there was not a word of complain from Kenny; he maintained his cheerful demeanour and took his time to answer all my silly questions.

Unfortunately, I really learned the hard way that you get what you pay for. I have lived in Columbia Heights for the last two years; previously, I lived in developing countries. I've even spent months living on camp sites. The Woodner is by far the worst place I've ever lived. There are some pretty shady characters that live in this building, thus the frequent police presence. The walls (and ceilings apparently) are thin, so you can constantly hear neighbors yelling, blaring music, or stomping from above. I also was unlucky enough to be present for a two separate incidents of assault that took place in the lobby. I came in during the aftermath of the first incident, which left pieces of the victim's clothing in the lobby. During the second incident, though, I had to hide in the dry cleaners until the police could contain the man. Also, ladies, if you don't enjoy being leered at by strange men, don't live here. There has been poop (which I very much hope belonged to an animal, though I recently saw a man peeing on the side of the building - next to a ground floor apartment window, so who knows) on multiple occasions in the stairwell.

The pool: True - it is nice to have the pool for 3 months of the year, though it's closed on Mondays and for an hour in the middle of every day. The grocery: it's convenient to have certainly, though overpriced. The gym: also nice to have, but it's tiny, with few machines, and parents bring their small kids who jump from machine to machine. There are also no cleaning chemicals for any of the machines. The laundry room: great to have in-building laundry facilities, but most buildings in DC do.

4/23/2018,43213,1.0,"I lived here for one year. My experience was actually reasonably pleasant relative to others who lived in the building, but there are a few key items that warrant a very poor rating for this building:

1. Security deposit: the company withheld about $750 from my security deposit for repairs to the unit, including cleaning and paint. I haven't looked at the landlord tenant law in California but generally speaking this type of stuff is covered under ordinary course wear and tear which is the responsibility of the landlord. I've never in my life had a security deposit withheld for damage to a unit so it's fairly clear to me Greystar uses security deposits as an extra source of cash. Incidentally I'm a lawyer and a friend of mine had asked for advice in dealing with this same issue when he moved out of the Venn. The fact that it happened to me as well suggests the management company regularly withholds money from tenants, knowing that most don't have the time or desire to spend hours fighting over a few hundred dollars. 

2. Hidden fees: your lease will be $x/month but be prepared to pay a few hundred extra dollars per month in various fees that you don't typically find in rental buildings. One example is the trash valet which most people don't seem to use, and is frankly kind of a dumb and disgusting concept to begin with. Basically, tenants pay monthly fees for the privilege of leaving their trash in the hallway, and the trash valet picks it up at some point. The result of this is that people leave their trash in the hallway and the entire floor smells like garbage. No one on our floor used the trash valet (fortunately) but we did pay for it.

3: theft and drug abuse: the bike room gets broken into about once a month, and management doesn't seem to be able to prevent it. People regularly use hard drugs on the street right outside the building entrances. At one point someone fell asleep with a needle in their arm leaning against the waller st. entrance. 

I will say that the guys who work on site are responsive and good guys, but the management company will stick it to you in a multitude of ways. Be prepared for it if you decide to live here",1.0,Silver,51.0,1.0,0.0

5/1/2018,43221,4.0,"I moved to AMLI South Lake Union this past February and so far, I'm loving it here. The management team were very communicative from the very start when I contacted them about potential apartments and tours. The apartment tour was very thorough (Katy gave me the tour) and I got to really see all the amenities and all the different layouts I was exploring at the time. With the seasonal promo, the rent was definitely an amazing deal in the SLU neighborhood, as many of the other apartments I saw were smaller and smaller, if not the same square footage. 

I moved into the Phase 1 one bedroom (available for 3D tour online) layout with a walk-in closet and three smaller closets in the hallway/kitchen area. The room is crazy spacious! All my friends who visited my place commented on the amount of space I had, and having so much space allowed me to decorate my apartment like I wanted. My previous apartment was about 100 sqft smaller and I wasn't able to buy all the furniture I wanted at the time. The maintenance has been pretty responsive and for the most part, everyone is very respectful. 

I did have a slight noise issue, but the management team (especially Cameron) worked with me throughout the entire process to get it resolved without having any additional problems arising. I would say the walls aren't completely noise proof, but the noise that you would hear from your neighbors definitely would not be super bothersome. I was just extremely sensitive at the time due to lack of sleep. 

The neighborhood is pretty quiet - even with all the constructions happening in SLU. I didn't want to live in the center of all the social scenes, so SLU was perfect for me to be close enough to the city life but also have quiet alone time to myself when I want to.

The staff are students themselves. They are liars. When asked point blank how many students live here, the answer was ""a small amount"". In actuality, the building is almost entirely UMass students. To give a more accurate representation of the building, The Peninsula hosts ""prospective UMass Students"" during college visiting weekends. 3.) They lie about location. They proclaim the address is in Boston. Actually once you move in they tell you the mailing address is Dorchester. For those not familiar with that city, it's one of the most dangerous and crime ridden cities in the greater Boston area. 4.) The security is a joke. They are rent-a-cops at best. Additionally, the students make friends with them, so most complaints fall on deaf ears. 5.) In the end, if you're a college graduate ... don't even think of living here. If you're a UMass student, this dorm is for you! The Peninsula is not filled with luxury apartments - rather, it's nothing but college students!

10/21/2007,39376,4.0,"I've lived at the Fillmore Center for little more than 3 1/2 years and after reading enough of these reviews, I thought that I'd add my two cents. I lived one year in the T2 building on the 11th floor (at the corner of Fillmore & Eddy) and currently 2 1/2 years in the S2 building on Eddy St., although my apartment borders on Steiner St. Overall, it's been a great place because it's uber-convenient for me, and I appreciate the sound-proofing. The year in the T2 building bordered on hell, but my experience in the S2 building has been a complete 180. In the T2 building, all of my neighbors on the 11th floor were psycho. I had hippie-squatters living across from me, the fighting ""domestic partner"" couple next to me, the psycho drugged-out woman around the corner, the asian prostitutes around the other corner. There is something about that building that attracts crazy people. Once I moved out of there, the S2 building seems to be the opposite, mostly professional people and very quiet. The fire alarm doesn't go off constantly, and you don't get the noise of Fillmore Street. Although, I miss my amazing view of the skyline, I don't miss the headaches of the 2 elevators for 190 apartments on 20 floors! Yes, two elevators for 190 apartments, and NO service elevator!!! Whoever designed that building should be shot. When one elevator breaks you are forced to wait 10 minutes for an elevator. Because there is no indicator on each floor, you don't know when an elevator is down and you are forced to wait, and wait, and wait. Then when one elevator finally does arrive, it is so packed full of people, you either have to wait another 10 minutes or walk down flight after flight of stairs. Pure hell especially if you have a busy schedule. I'm not sure if the management has a better handle on elevator maintenance, but it would take them forever to call for service when something went wrong. Now, my apartment in the S2 building faces the courtyard and I have a lovely waterfall outside of my unit. It is very, very quiet internally and at night I hear the soothing water. I have a wood-burning fireplace and a washer and dryer in my unit. In my few years here, the management has put some money into infrastructure and the neighborhood immediately surrounding the Fillmore Center has seen improvement. The Fillmore Heritage Center just opened, and Yoshi's with another fine dining restaurant are set to open. The police have stepped up their efforts at community policing, which I greatly appreciate. It seems to have helped as there hasn't been a major incident in the neighboring projects for months. There used to be shooting incidents all the time. Now, the police are almost always parked at Eddy and Laguna, usually just sitting in a patrol car, but their presence seems to curb the crackheads from just constantly shooting each other. If you are considering the Fillmore Center, you have to seriously consider that this place is bordered by the projects. This IS San Francisco, and you just have to walk a few blocks up Fillmore and you are in Pacific Heights. Completely different. Because of this, if this apartment were in Pacific Heights, you'd pay at least 1 1/2 times what you pay in the Fillmore. However, it is nice to have Japantown so close. There is a movie theater, Kabuki Springs & Spa, and Japanese restaurants and grocery store. Safeway, although extremely ------, is across the street. Something about grocery stores in poor black neighborhoods that you will always experience a 10 minute line and they don't care about customer service. I swore off this ------ Safeway about a year ago and have never been back. The food is garbage, the customer service is non-existent, and the clientele is uber ------. I used to see someone getting arrested for stealing every week, from diapers to liquor. That's not a problem though if you have a car, as Whole Foods and Rainbow are not too far away. A mile away but a world away. Their engineering department used to be horrible. It would take them forever to complete any maintenance request. I would have to call, leave messages, call again, until I got so frustrated that I would write to the property manager, which would solve the problem. Sometime last year they cleaned house with the engineering office-staff and things seemed to improve. Although several weeks ago, I asked for the carpet to be cleaned at the elevator landing because it smelled of urine, and it took them 3 weeks to finally complete it. It took them three weeks even though I followed up 10 days after my initial request. Like any corporate apartment complex, there doesn't seem to be enough engineering staff. However, the resident services staff has always been very nice and professional with me. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about EVERYONE that has worked at the center: sincere, professional and efficient. I always have to remember not to ""kill the messenger"" as they aren't management and they aren't performing the maintenance or fixing the issue at hand...they are simply the messengers. My only complaint with the Fillmore Center is that the rent keeps going up, up, up and there is no flexibility when it comes to negotiating. They have the attitude of take it or leave it. Even after giving them tens of thousands of dollars, they weren't willing to make any accommodation. The first year my rent went up $60/month, which is reasonable. The next year it went up $90, which is OK. The next year it went up $120. They kept insisting that the increases are because of the market. However, I don't feel that all of the increase is justified. It would seem more appropriate if they stuck it to the new tenants than their loyal tenants. It appears that they prefer a revolving door of new tenants so they can keep raising rent. The management kept telling me that their hands were tied because this is what their corporate office deemed appropriate. Corporate B.S. if you ask me. With that said and $4 extra a day, they have made some improvements to the property. They installed new lighting around the courtyards, which is simply impressive. It is very Hollywood now, whereas it used to be very dark and a little scary at night. The place is beautifully lit. They have a decent dog run and facilities if you have one. They have also made modest landscape improvements. The landscaping is one of the few factors that sets this community apart from others in San Francisco. The view of the trees and shrubs outside of my window is quite impressive, especially for San Francisco. It's a lush oasis in the middle of downtown-ish San Francisco. The other major plus to this community is the cement construction. You don't hear your neighbors ever, and you can be considerably loud without disturbing other tenants. This is huge when you are living with people on all sides of you. The concrete makes all the difference. The parking is convenient as well, especially if you living the S2 building. There is no direct parking garage access though if you live in the T2 building. You are forced to walk outside to the parking garage, which isn't a huge issue unless you have a large load to move or if it's raining. In the S2 building, you have direct elevator access to that same garage, so there is no trekking around the building with groceries through the rain. Overall, four and a half stars. I hope that the neighborhood continues to improve. Although, nothing can change that there are projects on three sides of this complex. And the rent keeps going up, up, up. I wonder with the market softening what they ask for next time around??",0.0,Non-Certified,45.0,0.0,1.0

While I have not had a bed bug problem, I have seen some when a tenant incorrect disposed of a mattress that is infected (I called management immediately and they promptly took care of removing it from where it was, wrapping it up, and steaming the entire area. Before I lived here I found one of those critters after coming home from one and another time after getting my prescriptions at CVS. The Woodner checks for infestations twice a year and I'm sure they are helpful with apartments that have infestations. Also there are a lot of children in the building and it has been shown that daycare, schools, and other child facilities acquire bed bugs easily. Not saying kids equal bed bug, just have seen the data. The Woodner has its issues but with 2,900 occupants things will occur and the building has no more than any smaller buildings. The prices are not high sky rocket and they have amenities like a market, video store, and other things. It is easy access to public transportation as well as having a shuttle that takes residents to UDC Red Line stop weekdays and to Giant on Saturdays. My assessment after being here a year...

8/16/2010,40406,1.0,"I lived at the Woodner for close to 2 years. I had planned on staying for at least 5 yrs but it was cut short due to the malice of those that work and run the Woodner. And yes, it s malice, because they know quite well what they are doing. It is on the S-line buses which was great for my commute to work downtown. An easy walk to Target, etc. A good price for a studio. However, the issues and ordeals are just too much for many people to put up with and that's what happened to me... 1. I knew before renting that there was a probability of bugs thanks to Apartment Ratings; so I came prepared and prepped the apartment for roaches before I moved-in (put roach motels behind the fridge and stove). I did not have a problem with bugs (I occasionally saw a single roach every month or two, but nothing horrid like other accounts). I also knew that the A/C wasn t that great so I moved in with a portable A/C unit that I used from the very first day that I moved in. 2. I had no issue with the move-in process. A smooth move-in with space at loading dock. I made three separate move-ins (moving items from NY, and two trips from the temporary group house in DC) as well as a trip from Ikea to move in furniture with a non-commercial vehicle. [Keep this thought in mind when I mention the move-out] 3. The mini-grocery store was very convenient. Prices were ok for the most part and it was great to just walk downstairs in order to get a pint of ice cream or a gallon of milk, etc. 4. Surprisingly the restaurant isn't that bad; I ate there 3 or 4 times. They have nightly specials and it s rather good and cheap. The service is speedy and nice. 5. The laundry rooms are often very busy during the day but I never had to wait long for a machine; but I tended to do laundry at night in order to have more room to spread out. The dryers are typical of an apartment complex: even on the lowest setting the heat is too hot. 6. There is a general sense of incompetence in the office: they had a few times billed me extra for no payment for the month prior or a lock-out fee when there were none and I had to rectify it with the office and it always was slow --- and I always had to show them when the check was cashed, etc. in order to prove that they even had it (I had my online banking send them an automatic check each month). I was not able to fix these problems on the phone because they never pick up the phone nor do they return phone messages. I called ten times during my residency there (I have on record the dates/times/issues) and never was able to get a live person or a phone call returned. I tried having a hole in my bathroom ceiling repaired but for some reason it never was; again, no phone calls returned when I would call. 7. When I first moved in there were lots of fire alarms and actually a real fire in the stairwell right next to my apartment (in between the levels). For the actual fire, security did come up and knock and yell loudly to get out and direct us to an alternate stairwell. I appreciated that. After awhile the alarms became less frequent. In terms of other noise: you can hear your neighbors. I only once had to have security go next door to tell the neighbor to quite down at 3am on a weeknight. I could hear a baby crying when I was in the bathroom (from the room over) but nothing so terrible. 8. While I lived there, there were a few hot water problems (during the winter when a cold shower isn't quite the same). I've heard from current residents that there have been issues with the A/C during the summer. 9. Most of the time packages were delivered to the valet aka dry cleaning without ordeal. However there were FOUR SEPARATE OCCASIONS where a package went missing and they denied having it (3 times) or that they gave it to someone else (the woman actually asked if I had a husband because when I went there to get the package she said she gave it to someone else luckily they were personal photos and the person who received the package in MY NAME and APARTMENT NUMBER had opened it up and taken it back to the valet three days later). I had to print out tracking forms from FedEx/UPS in order to prove that something was delivered and signed for (they would deny even having received or signed for them yet it was the same person who signed for all of the packages regardless of the shipping company --- I printed out all of the tracking slips to show the staff and they finally decided to look harder/find the package.) 10. Now is where the story gets even more interesting: One evening I enter my apartment and I see that my portable air conditioner has been moved more than 10-feet. There was NO NOTICE PRIOR TO ENTRY NOR WAS THERE NOTICE THAT ANYONE HAD ENTERED. I go to security and they do not see any entry in the log book stating that maintenance or anyone else has entered my apartment. They tell me to sit tight because it s probably just a maintenance call. They tell me that they will have someone call me in the morning. I m rather upset and decide to spend the night at a friend s house in Silver Spring. I didn't think straight and did not call the police because I did figure it was the incompetence of the Woodner (see #6) as well as nothing else seemed displaced/taken. The next morning I called promptly and left a message. In fact I left several messages. I finally just spoke with security and they kept transferring the phone call to the office and they got sick and tired of it that they went over to speak with the lady herself. I finally received a phone call just before they closed for the day and on the voicemail she stated that the building was doing a photo shoot in a nearby apartment and they saw a bookshelf in the window of my apartment that they needed to move for the photo and that is what they had done; and she apologized for not leaving any note. I phone her back the next day and request a copy of my lease. She says that it will be under my door in 24-hrs. 24-hrs later the lease is not under my door. I visit her personally (take time off of work). She knows who I am immediately and I inform her that I never received a copy she looks at her notes and says that she did send a copy up. I politely state that I will wait until another one is photocopied. She asks me for my apartment number and after I give it to her, another woman who is filling some documents nearby looks up and says oh the lock-out. I m puzzled by this and the woman says you had a lock-out yesterday, what a coincidence I have that document in my hand for your apartment. I m stunned because I DID NOT LOCK MYSELF OUT. I tell them this and the woman comes over: on the form is another person s name/signature that is not mine. There was no one else on my lease. I am now concerned that they had a stranger enter my apartment. The original lady tells me that she will send up a copy of the lease straight away. I leave the office and call my work to speak with an attorney over the situation (I am a fraud investigator [which explains why I know to keep all evidence such as documents and voicemails] and work with lots of attorneys). I secured a new apartment that week. In my 30-day notice for leaving I stated the reason why (the removal of the portable AC unit without notification). I get a letter back (from the SAME WOMAN WHO LEFT THE VOICEMAIL THE DAY AFTER THE INCIDENT) stating that the portable air conditioner is prohibited in the lease and they removed it for that reason. However, the lease does not say anything about air conditioners. It does prohibit washing machines and dish washers. An air conditioner is not either. AND, according to their voicemail, the manager had ok d the removal of a bookshelf for a photoshoot. I HAVE KEPT THE VOICEMAIL AND THE LETTER THEY SENT IN CASE ANYONE HAS DOUBTS. THEY LIE. and on top of it they broke the portable a/c unit. I did not pursue any legal action despite my boss desire: I just wanted out. 11. When I moved out (recall #2 above) the garage staff wanted to charge me for parking despite moving-out. They claimed that as a non-commercial vehicle they had to charge me. I had a SUV from ZipCar and told him it was a commercial vehicle(and I checked, it is indeed a commercial vehicle. I actually found Washington Post articles that they were commercial). When it took me 2.5 hrs to load the vehicle he told me that I had taken too long; he said it had taken 5hrs, and then changed it to 4hrs...and required me to pay. I refused to pay --- the Woodner has no valet carts to help move, the grocery carts they did have were all being used, the loading dock was filled with 3 other vehicles on each side (no easy way to put stuff in the SUV and the Woodner does not reserve the loading dock for move-ins/out), residents use the freight elevator as if it is a normal elevator thus sometimes I couldn't get my items into any elevator until it was 'clear'. I told the man to go and check about the lack of carts, etc. and see how long it would take him to fill an SUV (the seats were removed and it was loaded up to the very top) while having to drag things through the hallway and waiting for an elevator. I could only carry so much with each load as a 110lb woman. We had to get security involved because he threatened to call the police. If my cell phone would work in the garage I would have called the police myself. Even security thought that the garage attendant was out-of-line and asked him where I should go to load my vehicle since they don't allow it in the front of the building. I had the security staff member sign a statement that he thought the garage attendant was out-of-line, as well as his constant instance it had taken 4hrs (I could prove that I was at work during the time he stated that I was in the garage to show that he is a consistent liar). I HAVE THIS DOCUMENT TOO IN CASE SOMEONE HAS DOUBTS. I asked the security member for the manager s phone number. I called him promptly to alert him of this situation; did I get a phone call in return - no. Did I expect one - no. Yes, this did happen (when talking with other Woodner residents during this ordeal they were not shocked.... but now that I'm in a much better apartment I laugh at the complaints the tenants here at my new place have over such trivial stuff because the issues at the Woodner are grave).",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

Management was too young and too inexperienced to deal with residential issues. Maintenance was fabulous. No doorman, no concierge service while I was there. That desk in the lobby was never staffed, which was completely unacceptable. Was so happy to leave.

7/26/2011,40750,2.0,"We lived here for one year and had a very bad experience. Almost all residents are undergraduate, non-English speaking students from South America and the Middle East. A high percentage of other tenants are on section eight (a low-income housing program). There is excessive noise from barking dogs, music, people yelling to each other in the hallways, and doors slamming (this happens 24 hours a day). The walls are thin drywall, not concrete. At night, the hallways are filled with second-hand tobacco and sometimes pot smoke, which seeps into everyone's unit under doorways (there is 1.5 inch gap), through vents, and even through wall sockets. Management will not allow you to seal your door and will not seal your neighbor's door. Rent is above average for this area (East Cambridge), but Archstone is probably forced to do this because of the high turnover. In one year, my neighbors changed multiple times above, below, and on the left and right. Also, there are many hidden fees including water and sewage, a monthly trash fee, and several one-time fees when you move in. It's a large building, and the Cambridge police are there two to three times a week for noise complaints, ""domestic disturbances"" and even to serve restraining orders. This is published in the Cambridge police blog. In the year we lived there, there was a stabbing, a student was rushed to the hospital by ambulance following a drug overdose, and we came home one night to find a woman passed out on the floor in our hallway. It's not safe for children or families when students return from the nightclubs intoxicated. They drive drunk, urinate outside the building (even though there are free public restrooms), and loiter around the front entrance. Sometimes they throw up in the elevator and the concierge has to clean it up. To limit property damage, management regularly enters units for maintenance and to inspect them. This is very invasive and sometimes they do it illegally (without giving you 24 hours notice). Despite this, tenants are slowing destroying the building and Archstone never repairs it correctly. In two to three years, the building will not look as new as it does now (this is has already occurred in other, older Archstone locations). Archstone Northpoint is in a somewhat remote area, in what used to be a railroad yard. It's next to a run-down, mostly empty building that was once a hotdog factory, and surrounded by highways, parking lots, and train tracks. The North side faces route 93 and the commuter rail train yard (this is mostly wasteland). The East side almost touches Commercial Ave (a major four lane road). On the South, it's only a few feet from the Monsignor Obrien Highway (another four lane road) and the Green Line train tracks. The West side faces an enormous dirt and gravel parking lot. Aside from the Cambrideside Galleria Mall, it's one to two miles away from the best stores and restaurants in Cambridge and Boston. At night this is a very dark, lonely, 20 to 30 minute walk. The closest supermarket is a mile away (two miles round-trip). There are many better apartment buildings nearby, that are closer to major stores and restaurants. I strongly encourage you to use a realtor to find them because they don't always advertise online. One new trick Archstone (and others) do is they tell you they only have one or two units available, but if you drive by at night you'll see whole sections of the building are dark.

I should have known from the beginning it was going to be a bad choice but the move in special was too tempting. The day my husband and I came to sign the lease it turned into a 3 day process as it was coming to an end on the move in special which made me feel like they wanted to extend it to cheat us out of our gift card. Every time we went into the office together they geared their attention to the single people coming into the office when we had already been waiting over 30min and they had just walked in. The day of our move in the freight elevator broke, we were told it would be fixed in a few hours; it wasn't fixed for over a week resulting in us having to leave our bed and dining room table as they didn't fit in the normal elevator and them getting stolen even after I put up signs saying they belonged to someone.I call and email the office frequently and I understand they get lots of email but some kind of response would be nice. They give you a flyer saying to call this number to set up all your utilities so I call, they are unhelpful i spent over a month trying to figure out how to hook up my gas and electric so i finally went to the office and they tell me that its a RUBS system and I don't have to do anything. We are military and it was so much more difficult than anywhere else I've lived to get the military clause. Lastly, they failed to give me a parking permit even though I already had my car registered with the office and they still towed it, gave me no notice and expect me to pay the towing fees when it is something that i couldn't avoid.

My experience with this complex has been awful and I don't even live here (even though I had all intentions to move as soon as my lease was up)!!!
My best friend lives here and I often visit her and since we enjoy going out I usually pick her up from here. Last night we decided to take her car so I had to park in the guest parking. Now let me explain, the guest parking spaces are limited to a few spots only and most residents will park there so GOODLUCK!!!
Now I parked and we were out and came back at 3 am. we never planned to come back so late but stuff happened and as soon as we came back we went to print me a parking pass because we decided to all stay together that night. I printed the pass at 3:21am and my car was called in at 3:24 am to be towed!!!!
WE literally drove back to the garage and my car was gone. (do not even get me started on the fact that my emergency brake was up and so my tires were practically violated last night!!!!!!!)
I immediately call and the operator tells me there is no way to help me and that I have to pay and release my car. As useless as that was we drove over to the towing lot to get my car back. 
A little background on the towing company this complex works with, Henry's, is that they are the crappiest company I had to ever deal with. Do not get me started on how disrespectful they are and how Camden practically forces you to deal with such poor service. I released my car and the next morning I went to the leasing office to speak to a manager and see how they can make this a more pleasant experience for me and help out. I was told that even I had a pass printed was going back to put it on my car there was nothing the assistant, Jorge, could do for me. 
A luxury apartment complex with rent not so cheap, could not refund me for the money I paid THEIR VENDOR who ruined my tires and moved my car to the sketchiest lots one had to step foot on. It definitely did not help the matter that he just kept saying there is nothing he can do when he was sitting in a customer service position. I was the customer but I received no service whatsoever.

Neighbor noise wise I don't personally hear a lot of- every once in a while I hear a person or music but never enough to really irritate me.

Gym is large and nice- although it would be even better if they had a  Peloton bike like some other new buildings are starting to add. Also- there are now so many fast casual food options within mere feet of the front door (Chopt, chipotle, Taylor's, Rasa and soon to come Declaration Pizza) and the metro is less than 5 minute walk. 

I know parking is always a premium and I don't personally have a car but I do wish they had some guest spots (even for a charge) for my visitors. Especially during nats season when it gets super challenging.",1.0,Silver,53.0,5.0,1.0

5/20/2019,43605,5.0,"Katherine was amazing on our move from Washington State to the Mastlight. We did everything via phone/email and it worked flawlessly. She kept in constant contact which also helped calm my nerves. She was professional and thorough and provided world class customer service. 

As for the apartment, it's above average with nice upgrades from most you'll see. Floors are a little thin but maybe the person above me walks on their heels, that's apartment living though. They have garbage valet that's free of charge that pics up your garbage right from your door. Nice area for packages and even a dog wash facility. Your apartment comes with a plastic key fob thingy that gets you into your apartment and to the building. And one last thing that is rare in apartments these days, lots of open uncovered parking!

One bonus is that it's directly across from the old Navy Air Base and the runways are an excellent place to take a jog or walk without worrying about traffic. It's a little out of the way for shopping but it's right on the t line. My drive into/from DT Boston takes about an hour during rush hour.

We went to see the apts twice all the way from the city and one of the employees said she'd get back to us with a sweet deal. We were excited. After not having heard any detail, my husband called the office and talked to Zac who was rather rude and condescending in his manner like he was doing a favor giving us the rates. On speaking with the manager, she kept on insisting that since she wasn't in any of the convos she wasn't sure what to think...basically not agreeing that her employees were at fault. She raised her voice and was extremely rude and disrespectful when we tried explaining to her what a waste of time it had been. She gave us another rate which was higher than what was quoted initially and kept saying that rates change everyday - again something they didn't bother telling us! Now we have lost close to 3 weeks trying to figure out the best apt for us and on top of that treated very poorly by the staff. We were in a time crunch and had trusted them to get back to us with the details on the rates as we were ready to sign the lease. In the end, I got super heated and told them we weren't interested anymore cause what's the point of living for 14 months in a place where you're treated like total shit even before having signed the lease and pay $2000 in rent every month!! I'm really disappointed because I really was in love with the apts. Had the management been a bit more professional and had stuck to their word, we would have signed the lease.

8/11/2017,42958,5.0,"I've lived at Viktoria for 7 months now, so far things have been generally great and getting better.

Reasons why Viktoria has been pretty great for me:
- Close to Amazon HQ, a 15 minute walk to Day 1
- Close to lots of food options, including stuff at Pike Place Market
- Close to Target, although they're a bit lacking in the groceries department
- Close to public transport, tons of bus lines as well as the Link Light Rail that goes to UW (more food) and the airport
- Modern interior, easy to clean hardwood floors and giant windows
- Rich appliance set: in unit W/D, AC, dishwasher, oven, microwave oven, and fridge

Amenities: 
- Rooftop access with sweeping views, lots of space for hanging out with friends, BBQ grills, and a pool table
- 7th floor gym with a squat rack ($80/mo back in my pocket), and free towels you can throw into a basket when you're done
- 8th floor office space with a printer (bring your own paper, still handy)
- Movie room that I don't really use
- 24/7 staffed front desk that holds packages for you
- Resident events like Saturday Brunch and Wine Wednesdays
- The front desk staff and leasing staff are top notch. April downstairs is delightful, remembering everyone's name and giving a heartfelt welcome every time she sees you. Keith from the leasing office was very professional when he showed me around and continues to be responsive to resident feedback.

Since I moved in, Viktoria's added:
- Fresh flowers at the front desk
- Spa water and coffee at the front desk on weekends
- A hella-dope fully automatic coffee machine on the rooftop. I love it. It makes the rooftop feel like a membership-only airport lounge with no snacks but unbeatable views.

Complaints:
- Sometimes, the entrance to the building is a bit smelly. I'm not sure what the cause is.
- Sometimes, people leave a mess on the rooftop when they're done. The cleaning staff usually takes care of it, but it's still unpleasant.

Utilities:
- NB. Building utilities are shared among all residents based on the square footage of their apartment. So the lights in common areas and stuff. I'd have to decipher my bill at some point to identify the cost of common utilities, but my entire utility bill including my personal use 
clocks in at around $95/mo.

I live in the T3 building (1420 Turk) and my building is really quiet. It's right across the street from the SFPD station too. Apt faces the courtyard so I never hear anything from the street. Courtyard is really pretty; the FCA people keep their grounds looking nice, even if the entire neighborhood isn't much to look at. Parking is REALLY expensive ($230) but is also super safe. I never worry about my car here. Maintenance is pretty quick to respond to any requests. We haven't had a lot of issues, just the closet doors coming off their tracks.

8/4/2015,42220,2.0,"My husband, dog, and I lived in the Kensington from June 2014 - June 2015. Moving from St. Louis to Boston, we had trouble finding an apartment in Boston that we liked, so we went with the Kensington. We figured the ""full service"" in terms of concierge staff, gym, pool, not having to shovel the sidewalks for our first winter in Boston, etc., would be worth the money. We paid $5,000 for a two bedroom, two bath. Yes, there are good things about the Kensington; see the other reviews. Keep in mind that the Kensington incentivizes residents to write good reviews online by giving away gift cards. So, the reviews may (or may not) be truthful. Here are reasons why we did NOT like living in the Kensington: - The Kensington lost two Amazon packages of ours. The packages contained necessary dog supplies (winter supplies for dog paws, and a 40 pound bag of dog food). By losing both of these packages, our dog would not go out in the wintertime and I had to clean up pee and poop every day. I am not exaggerating. In addition, by losing a 40 pound bag of dog food (how do you ""lose"" this?), I had to have a friend rent a car and drive out of town to buy the difficult to find dog food outside the city. After way too many frustrated emails to the office staff, they reluctantly gave me $150 for each lost package. The first $150 was supposed to appear as a credit on my rent bill. It didn't. Yet more emails to the staff, and it took nearly a month to get it resolved. In general, the office staff was difficult to work with, and lacked any sort of sympathy or consideration for our frustration. - Smoking. There is a small garden/courtyard at the front of the building next to the entrance. People stand around an smoke there. A LOT. We asked the office staff and the front desk staff multiple times to enforce that people not smoke. The Kensington even mentioned in their advertising that it's a non-smoking business and a ""healthy"" living environment. If you'd like to walk through a cloud of smoke every time you come home, live here. - Recycling. The Kensington building is LEED certified. Kudos. The rest of their building is the complete opposite of being environmentally friendly. When they have events every week, everything goes into the trash - including beer cans, beer bottles, and wine bottles. They don't recycle any of it. In addition, the trash chutes appear to have an outdated system. For recycling, there are three different buttons (newspaper, glass, plastic). I'm sure people are too lazy to sort their recycling, so many likely throw everything into the trash. IF, however, you go to the ground level where the dumpsters are kept, all recycling is co-mingle. Meaning, ALL recyclables can be put in one bag. The Kensington needs to update the trash chute system and/or encourage residents to co-mingle their recycling. - Neighbors. The Kensington advertises that they don't rent to undergrads. That's utterly false. There are tons of young 20 year olds around. Our neighbor constantly played loud music very late and into the early morning. The Kensington also appears to rent out rooms to families, temporary stays, etc. This is not a building of older professionals. It is a building that is far from peaceful and it lacks community. (Note that the noise outside the building is less noticeable during the daytime than at night. We lived on the 16th floor and could still hear honking, sirens, even drunk people yelling loudly from the two strip clubs next door at night.) - Events. The Kensington has events almost every week, often with free food and free alcohol. Perhaps the Kensington is trying to create a community. I (and many others), on the other hand, would take the food and drinks and go back up to our apartments. I'd much rather have cheaper rent than be subsidizing food and booze for other people. Yes, there are many things good about the Kensington (see other reviews). But I do NOT recommend living there if any of the above would bother you.

Ed is typically around all the weekends or later in the evenings. You will love him if you're looking at the building! He's a little bit of celebrity in this building and is such a staple. He's always there to greet you with a smile. He genuinely and sincerely cares. He'll let you know if you have a package or ask you if you're expecting anything to arrive so he will keep track for you. He's so dependable. He always checks with you before allowing anyone to enter (whether it's delivery, a friend, etc) He wants to make sure everyone feels safe and is safe in their home. 
Katrina is usually there in the mornings, she's there to greet you when it's Monday and the coffee hasn't hit yet. She's so sweet and is so sincere. She's a great person to see every morning on the way to the office. 
The maintenance staff is wonderful as well- you never wait long for them to help and are so professional. They'll replace things no question and want to make sure you're taken care of and if they can help with anything else before they go. I let them in my apartment whether I'm home or not and they always are so friendly and will leave a note if they fixed something while you were out.
This building is awesome-- for a more simple breakdown, see below:

PROs:
-The concierge staff whether it's Ed, Katrina, or Amy
-Floor to ceiling windows
-Maintenance is so helpful and you never wait over 2 hours for someone to assist you (they also change filters for you every couple of months)
-Huge island in the kitchen with beautiful storage (lots of storage) and updated appliances
-Soft hardwood floors that compliment the aesthetics beautifully
-Spa bathrooms
-Perfect size master bedrooms (can fit a king bed, dresser, and we fit a shelving unit)
-Views whether you face N,E,S, or W
-An actual Gym
-Grilling stations with TVs and lounge area
-Beautiful rooftop pool with cabanas, spa and the view is unmatched in River North
-Dog Spa! 
-Package room and laser luxs

Cons: 
-Sometimes you can wait 2-5 minutes in the morning for the elevators. This is only typical if someone is using one for moving
-The area is getting better, but it's missing a close grocery store to just pop in and grab food
-Franklin Street (street southwest from the building) can be shady. Important to have a good door staff (like Ed!!!!!!!) to always make you feel safe in your home.",1.0,Certified,42.0,5.0,1.0

There have been gas fume issues like posters said from the digging out of the former gas station lot next door which lasted 4 months. But we bought a high end gas air purifier and OHS reimbursed us. Our apt has smelled fine ever since.  The pool is great. Hot tubs malfunction occasionally but everything in a building like this does at some point.  Technology always fails at some point. The amenity rooms are beautiful we use them all the time. The TVs have had issues with remote controls not working which did render them useless for a while.  

We use the gym every day. There is nothing easier than walking down a few flights to go workout. Love the gym. They usually have wipes to wipe things down. Sometimes they aren't there. I put that on use/purchasing not keeping up. But as much as we're there no one is dripping buckets on anything for hours at a time. And OHS supplies fresh towels so you can dry wipe things down.   

We haven't had management issues much. We ask for things, we get them. It's a lot easier living here than in our own house on the hill which we left temporarily. No yard to tend, break ins, fake vendors at your door etc.  It's pretty easy living. 

Noise. I can't hear anyone next door to us. And I've asked and they can't hear us. 
Interior home: appliances a little small (washer dryer) for a family but work well.  Nothing has broken down. 

Neighbors good.  But that can change floor to floor. 

Pollution. Hmm it's in a very heavily under construction area. And next to south capitol street.  When you walk outside it's pretty a polluted smell. That's no fault of OHS. Lots of cars, construction heavy dirty air here.  Once you get further away it gets better but DC is heavily polluted no matter where you go. 

People have issues with this place. I get it. There have been issues. But many of those people are staying still. Because it's still nice and it can be annoying to move. we like it. We're staying a bit longer.

Adding more because of my experience yesterday.  We have used tape on walls to put up my daughter's art. We've pulled it off and along came drywall chips leaving the wall super ugly. So I called maintenance asking if by chance they could help us (so I didn't have to go buy every tool myself).  Today they came. Patched and primed in one hour and we're set.

7/10/2018,43291,2.0,"Had I written this review a few months after moving in approximately 2 years ago, it likely would have been a 4 or 5.  At that time, however, the building was not yet fully occupied, and since things have filled up the building management simply hasn't been able to or has not made the effort to cope with the various aspects of managing the building.

In general, I'd caution readers from heavily weighting reviews that mention only having lived in the building for a couple of months or less, as many of the building's most significant management issues are the kinds of things that you begin to notice after they happen repeatedly over the course of months.  While it seems a bit silly to complain about many of the things in isolation below, I have tried to outline what has led me to feel this way about the building below.  It simply seems that with all of the options for this kind of apartment in Boston now, AVA is falling behind at this property.

Pros:

Quick, attentive, and effective maintenance team.  I want to make clear that my complaints about building management do not extend to them, as any maintenance issues we have had have been quickly resolved.

Location is great.

Great views from many units when not obstructed by construction cranes.

Good amenities (when not ""reserved"" at the last minute, see below).

Cons:

Lack of any effective action from the building regarding construction/noise issues.  While I understand that the building can only do so much about the multiple construction sites around the building, there has been essentially no visible advocacy for residents (as views are obstructed, crane strobe lights blink at dawn/dusk, and noise starts at 6 AM (backup alarms from trucks arriving prior to the technical 7 AM construction start time)).  Additionally, while I know the rental agents mention noise from the Bijou nightclub when showing units, also be aware that closing time from the Lagrange Street strip clubs can bring a solid 20 minutes of car horns and loud music in the middle of the night on some Fridays/Saturdays.

Prepare for a pond of pet urine upon leaving and returning to the building each day.  While I appreciate that the building is ""pet friendly"", there has been very minimal effort to police where pets go and the maintenance team would be swamped trying to cleanup the daily deluge that occurs right outside the Lagrange Street entrance to the building.

Poorly programmed elevators.  Any longtime resident of this building will tell you that you can end up waiting 5 minutes for an elevator, while 3 of the 4 sit idle on the upper floors.  It certainly seems that either the elevator system was dirt cheap, or that the building could bring in a good technician to reprogram the system.

Parking service leaves much to be desired, given the $350/month cost.  Since it is effectively the only parking option for residents, it is inexcusable when you follow the specified texting procedure to have your car retrieved only to find that your car is not available for 30 minutes or the system fails and the garage claims to have not received the text message request leaving you with an even longer wait.

Cheap construction.  While this isn't a really significant issue if you are careful with your apartment's amenities, the paint has a tendency to mark if you look at it funny and there are some odd design choices in our unit such as placing both thermostats in one room that results in uneven heating/cooling throughout the unit.

Building management has fallen into the habit of announcing same-day reservations of the building's amenities that prevent residents from using them (most notably the roof deck, which includes the grills that were a key part of why we originally chose this building over the similar ones around).  While the lease gives the building the right to do this, it would certainly be much fairer to residents to give some semblance of advanced notice.

General lack of response from management.  It seems to me that the leasing office is generally responsible for managing the building, rather than having somebody/a team that is actually responsible for community/building management.  Naturally, the leasing agents' job is to rent apartments rather than worry about what happens after the leases are signed, which I think contributes to the management issues.   There are some simple things that could be easily done like naming a clear point-person for building/community issues, establishing an online calendar and a clear reservation policy to avoid the last minute amenity reservation issues, etc.",1.0,Silver,53.0,2.0,0.0

9/11/2015,42258,1.0,"Poorly built, terrible maintenance, high management turnover, and break ins. I have lived here about 5 months and all I can say is STAY AWAY! The previous reviews are pretty spot on. I can't wait for our lease to end so we can get out. This is easily the worst place I have lived and oddly one of the priciest. The complex is about a year old and has all the surface bells and whistles you would expect like ceramic tile in bathroom, walk in showers, granite counter tops, high ceilings, etc. However, the beauty is only skin deep. The complex was thrown up overnight and it shows badly in units, common areas, etc. Maintenance simply cannot keep up with all the issues. Our unit and others had badly buckled sheet rock which required extensive repairs. The buckled walls were an interesting talking point when guests came over. We have a split door casing that has been covered by putty 3 times, unfortunately the putty does not last long and the casing buckles and cracks further. We had a partially unpainted living room wall upon move in and other areas needed touch up. A few other issues were our tubs were not caulked completely, broken ceiling fan, our kitchen faucet broke after a month and had to be replaced, and we had electrical outlets that did not work. The maintenance guys have been nice, but unbelievably badly managed. It took 4 months to get the above mentioned split door casing corrected to a decent level. Maintenance came 4 times to work on the door casing. They actually got it to look decent for a while, but for some reason came back in and ripped it up back to how it looked 3 months ago and had to repair again. Please explain that one to me. It took 4 weeks to get the buckled walls repaired in the 2 bedrooms. I had to put in multiple work orders and speak with the regional manager for all repairs completed above. Absolutely nothing has gotten down without calling corporate folks. The wall repair was a half-hearted attempt at best as the buckling is still there, just less pronounced. It took 5 weeks to get the wall paint touched up, again only after calling the regional manager. Maintenance had to come 3 times as they painted the wrong areas the first time and then only did a partial job the second time. As far as common areas, they look poorly built like the rest of the complex. My biggest issue is security doors from the building to the parking garage do not fully close and remain propped open all day on my and others. This has been the case since we moved in 5 months ago, May 2015. The multiple work orders I personally put in on those doors have gone unanswered. Carpet in the hallway is fine on my floor because I am on the floor with the model. The other floors are not so lucky as noted below. There have been several break ins and cars stolen right out of the garage. I can't help but think the broken security doors assisted the apartment thieves. The onsite cop was run away as mentioned in a prior review. They hired a rent a cop for a few weeks in July after the rash of break ins, but I don't see him anymore. Resident events, I don't have much to add. They have stopped completely with the new management team, Fairfield residential. Under the old company they had a few events, but they were all held Monday - Friday between 9 - 5, so anyone with a regular job was unable to attend. The office team could care less when asked about having later events or more weekend events. People tell me they put in work orders at other complexes for simple things like lights etc. My god I cannot imagine putting in a work order for such things at 11600. It is hard enough to get major things corrected, unless you waste a ton of time calling the corporate office. Other tenants we have spoken with have noted similar issues and witnessed attempted break ins on the first floor. Not many people are happy here.

However, the last year we have lived here (May 2006-April 2007), everything has become horrible. We got new neighbors who blast their music non-stop and despite repeated complaints to the management, they still continue to blast music without getting evicted. It specifically states in the lease that you sign, high levels of noise will not be tolerated as everyone is entitled to peace and quiet. Ironic, considering they have done absolutely nothing to the neighbors we have complained about since they moved in last August. The MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE! The front door staff is so lazy at night, any crazed person could get past the front door which defeats the purpose of having a door man. The parking lot is convenient except for during the day when they open it up to the community college students and they hit your car or they sell all availabe spaces, so don't plan on coming back until after classes are through for the day if you want parking. Last year, there was a broken pipe in the apartment above us, and instead of mentioning to the apartments below them, the ignore the problem. Lucky us, we come to find out that all of the stuff in the storage area of our closet was sitting in mold, mildew, fungus, bugs and standing water.

This building is for 40+ year olds without kids, and people making $120k who prefer to uber around and eat in the city but live right next to Amazon.

5/4/2014,41763,5.0,"This is a great place to live. The staff are absolutely spectacular. I didn't know that an apartment like this existed, and I've have lived in a lot of them. They are genuinely nice and helpful. Foulger-Pratt does a great job hiring the right people. They have zero tolerance for lack of professionalism in their employees. It seems harsh, but that is what keeps things glued together. Staff are receptive and eager to bring neighbors together (book club, holidays, pool party, etc.) You can buy discount movie tickets. They often post local activities and offer coupons. Being that it is new, you get the luxury of enjoying a nice clean, damage-free environment. Neighbors are eager to socialize as well. It may be because many are new to the area. Summer is the best time to socialize because people are out and about. Only minor complaints: If your apartment window is over Ellsworth (north side) only... my apartment unit is across from a parking garage. At night it is stadium bright. Also, the noise from street entertainers on the weekends was obnoxious on occasion. They are legally allowed to blast music 24/7. Luckily, the windows are pretty sound proof. It takes a lot to hear it. Blackout curtains will do the trick for the brightness. Also, be prepared to have a bit of a hike to the elevator is you live on that side. Forgetting something is a bummer. Walking your pet in the middle of the night is a big to-do. However, you make it work. You are closer to the city after all and more secure. Throughout the building, the fire alarm is piercingly loud. My poor dog is now afraid of certain beeping noises. Unfortunately, that is now the standard, up-to-code fire alarm system. There is nothing they can do about it. Hey, it works! :) Parking: I was lucky to secure a spot so I gave it 5 stars. Unfortunately, they did not build this building with enough parking for all the residents. However, there are a few parking garages in the area. It's just a bummer to walk to them, and they do not have a lot of security. Safety: There are some non-violent crimes in the area, but overall it feels much safer than any other part of Silver Spring. Everything you need is right here. Yes, I've seen a couple of drug dealers arrested in town. I think they scout people on these streets. However, the police are always around. This is the reality of living in the DC area. Plus, this area is going through a rapid revitalization. Traffic/Transportation: Access to the beltway is great. Traffic is pretty average. I would say you have the luxury of some good backroad options to get where you need to go. The Metro is about a 12 minute walk. I recommend walking down Ellsworth and going around the Discovery Communications Building. Wayne takes you a bit out of the way. When driving in this region, you have to watch for speed cameras. It's always ready to get you. Environment: You get a seriously clean place with quality building materials. There are zero pests. The air quality is great. They clean it every day of the week. The grounds are well-maintained year round. They enforce preventing pet messes, aggressive dogs, or dogs in the common areas. Dog walking; There are plenty of neighborhoods to walk your dog. However, there is currently no doggie park. I heard they are building one in the park across the street. The nearest dog park is currently 15 minutes away (Wheaton Dog Park). Shopping/Restaurants: You are very close to several shopping areas in the region. I recommend not going to Wheaton Mall. Instead, go to Bethesda, North Bethesda, Columbia, Rockville, or Wisconsin Place. Grocery stores are plentiful and there is parking available. Safeway and Wholefoods are within walking distance. Trader Joe's is a short ride away. Just make sure to avoid weekends there, because the parking lot is entirely too small. There are a lot of places to eat around here. If you like Sushi, there are several good places. The small, family owned restaurants can offer some of the best food. So, don't overlook them. Neighbors: Again, there are a lot of social activities. I'm not sure how they do it, but I have met some of the nicest people here. We've even gotten together to place games and watch movies. There aren't a lot of kids here at the moment. It's not really a great place long-term if you have very active little kids. However, when the weather is nice, there is a lot of places to go beyond the apartment (playgrounds, Veterans Plaza, outdoor children's concerts, pottery painting, movies, National Zoo, Six Flags, etc.)",1.0,Silver,52.0,5.0,1.0

8/4/2015,42220,2.0,"My husband, dog, and I lived in the Kensington from June 2014 - June 2015. Moving from St. Louis to Boston, we had trouble finding an apartment in Boston that we liked, so we went with the Kensington. We figured the ""full service"" in terms of concierge staff, gym, pool, not having to shovel the sidewalks for our first winter in Boston, etc., would be worth the money. We paid $5,000 for a two bedroom, two bath.

Yes, there are good things about the Kensington; see the other reviews. Keep in mind that the Kensington incentivizes residents to write good reviews online by giving away gift cards. So, the reviews may (or may not) be truthful.

Here are reasons why we did NOT like living in the Kensington:

 - The Kensington lost two Amazon packages of ours. The packages contained necessary dog supplies (winter supplies for dog paws, and a 40 pound bag of dog food). By losing both of these packages, our dog would not go out in the wintertime and I had to clean up pee and poop every day. I am not exaggerating. In addition, by losing a 40 pound bag of dog food (how do you ""lose"" this?), I had to have a friend rent a car and drive out of town to buy the difficult to find dog food outside the city. After way too many frustrated emails to the office staff, they reluctantly gave me $150 for each lost package. The first $150 was supposed to appear as a credit on my rent bill. It didn't. Yet more emails to the staff, and it took nearly a month to get it resolved. In general, the office staff was difficult to work with, and lacked any sort of sympathy or consideration for our frustration.

 - Smoking. There is a small garden/courtyard at the front of the building next to the entrance. People stand around an smoke there. A LOT. We asked the office staff and the front desk staff multiple times to enforce that people not smoke. The Kensington even mentioned in their advertising that it's a non-smoking business and a ""healthy"" living environment. If you'd like to walk through a cloud of smoke every time you come home, live here.

 - Recycling. The Kensington building is LEED certified. Kudos. The rest of their building is the complete opposite of being environmentally friendly. When they have events every week, everything goes into the trash - including beer cans, beer bottles, and wine bottles. They don't recycle any of it. In addition, the trash chutes appear to have an outdated system. For recycling, there are three different buttons (newspaper, glass, plastic). I'm sure people are too lazy to sort their recycling, so many likely throw everything into the trash. IF, however, you go to the ground level where the dumpsters are kept, all recycling is co-mingle. Meaning, ALL recyclables can be put in one bag. The Kensington needs to update the trash chute system and/or encourage residents to co-mingle their recycling.

 - Neighbors. The Kensington advertises that they don't rent to undergrads. That's utterly false. There are tons of young 20 year olds around. Our neighbor constantly played loud music very late and into the early morning. The Kensington also appears to rent out rooms to families, temporary stays, etc. This is not a building of older professionals. It is a building that is far from peaceful and it lacks community. (Note that the noise outside the building is less noticeable during the daytime than at night. We lived on the 16th floor and could still hear honking, sirens, even drunk people yelling loudly from the two strip clubs next door at night.)

 - Events. The Kensington has events almost every week, often with free food and free alcohol. Perhaps the Kensington is trying to create a community. I (and many others), on the other hand, would take the food and drinks and go back up to our apartments. I'd much rather have cheaper rent than be subsidizing food and booze for other people.

Yes, there are many things good about the Kensington (see other reviews). But I do NOT recommend living there if any of the above would bother you. It's definitely not worth the money or the headaches or the second hand smoke.",1.0,Gold,63.0,2.0,0.0

Apartments are somewhat well kept minus a few minus issues. 1.) Paint job seems questionable and a little rushed but we're planning to request touch up paint to cover up marks from moving in. If you look at the walls too hard, they leave a scratch lol ijs ... maybe using a better quality of paint. Everything else was really clean. 

Neighbors - walls are a little thin. We have a guitarist on one side who practice quite often and sings occasionally. Really doesn't bother us as much as the kid who runs around upstairs - was two steps away from going up there just to introduce ourselves. During the week, it's a little quieter upstairs. Hoping this does not become a problem in the near future b/c we're going to go deaf trying to drown out the noise. 

The washer and dryer - OH MY! Could it get any worst. If I'm paying for water and electricity, why can't I control my own usage. This energy and water saver thing is counter productive. Washing one load of clothes approximately 2-3 times just to make sure they're clean b/c the washing machine doesn't completely fill with water. 

Garage - parking is okay, but the whole motion detective thing doesn't make any sense!! Once again, they're trying to conserve energy but is it safe to have the garage go completely dark if no activity is detected. Leaving at 5am in the morning, you're met with a pitch black garage. Not a fan!! The lights do come on one by one as you're walking pass, but again, is this safe? 

Overall, like living here and it's convenient and their amenities are really nice... hoping the minor things will get better such as the noise above us and dark garage. Everything else is a little tolerable as we can make it work for now.

Some things I don't like about the building:  

The plumbing is a lot slower than ordinary to get hot or go back to cold. 

The aromatics ventilated into the common areas are too strong, I wish they'd tone that down a notch too. 

The smoke detectors in the apartments are apparently ""up to the latest regulations"" which means they are SUPER sensitive. Smoking even a small amount of oil in a pan triggers a deafening alarm that screams FIRE! FIRE! In fact the first time I preheated the oven it triggered. I have to blow a fan directly on the sensor every time I cook. You can forget about even trying to sear a steak.

I lived on the first floor, and could occassionally hear a dog running around above me but only on the areas that were wood flooring like the kitchen floor, and it wasn't enough to bother me. Also, I usually had my tv or music on, so I wouldn't notice it all then. If people walking above you bothers you, then go buy a house. Or better yet, buy a condo, and see the same thing happen, then who are you going to complain to? Yeah, I agree that prices can vary widely for the apartments and extras (storage/parking). But it's sales...it works off of supply and demand. If they had like 2 open apartments when you looked, they knew they could easily rent them, so they're not going to budge on price or give you any freebies, but if they had 20 open apartments, they're probably going to do just about anything they can (within reasonable limits) to get you to rent, so that they don't go a whole month or more without getting rent from that apartment.

10/12/2017,43020,5.0,"My wife and I moved into the Dwight at the beginning of September and are thrilled that we did.  Being the first to live in a unit is always nice, as the appliances, floors, and walls are brand new and unblemished.  While the square footage for a 1 BR is a bit small (611 sqft for our unit), the layout is efficient and closets provide ample space, assuming you are good at vertical storage :)  The large windows provide excellent light during the day time, so I rarely need to keep the lights on if/when I work from home.

With regards to the building itself, the amenities are great.  Common areas are clean and well-kept.  The rooftop deck with 2 grilles and ample seating on the outdoor furniture is really a HUGE selling point for me.  Whenever friends visit, we usually stop by our unit just long enough to give them a quick tour and grab a drink before heading up to the roof to enjoy the warm Berkeley Fall weather and awesome views of the Bay.

Building security was a key concern of ours, given the proximity to downtown Berkeley, but the building earns top marks in that category as well.  There are multiple layers of security (key fob for front door and elevator, traditional key for units) and we have never felt unsafe in our first six weeks at The Dwight.

Finally, I'll address some comments from other reviewers on the property's management.  Jaspal and Lexi are incredibly responsive at all hours, so I'm not sure where the ""unresponsive"" comments are coming from as that has not been our experience at all.

In summary, my wife and I would happily recommend The Dwight to our friends and family and we're thrilled that we made the decision to call The Dwight our home.",1.0,Gold,62.0,5.0,1.0

I think there are far better apartment communities who represent luxury. See Pros/Cons below:\nPros:\n- Great apartment itself, nice appliances\n- Maintenance comes super quick to fix any issues \n- Free guest parking (limited)\n- 24/7 gym\n- Easy access to 75 N\n- Pizza restaurant next door\n- Secure and safe building\n- Across the street to MARTA\n\nCons: \n- Amenities are not 24/7 (which I find majority of other high rises are around the area. IE Modera, Piedmont House, Icon)\n- Elevators are atrocious. It can take 10  minutes to get one. The concierge has absolutely no idea why an elevator has been sitting on a floor for over 24 hours. I get move-ins reserve them, but I am sure there is a window. And the covers are never taken off and looks trashy.\n- Package room - a complete mess. Very challenging to even find your package and hope no one takes it. Unorganized.\n- Amenities are constantly rented out, which makes them unusable for ALL other residents. Absolutely no communication from Management on when that will be so others can plan according (no true resident dashboard or communication system that many other high rises have).\n- If you face the south side, a 19 story Hampton In is being built, which could take up most of your view. Almost 24/7 construction (although that\'s what you get living in the city.. just be mindful)\n- The concierge and leasing team have zero communication and do not communicate well. \n- It took me almost 5 months to get back access to the package lockers (was a computer glitch on their part).\n- Huge identity crisis. For being an ""arts center"" Amli has the saddest ""art gallery"" I have ever seen. Literally looks like something out of the flea market. \n- If you face the south side, be prepared that during the summer it will be so hot, that it is unbearable to sleep in the bedroom. Expect $180-$250 elec bills. \n\nAll in all, the apartment itself was nice and I felt safe, which are huge bonuses. But, I think they have a lot of work to do before they can be considered luxury.

Long time residents and seniors on fixed incomes have been displaced by their sky rocketing rental increases at The Fillmore Center. We´re talking 20-100% a MONTH increases here not a 3-7% COL increase.  When asked why an individuals rent needs to be raised from $1200 to $1800 a month (Yes out-o-staters that´s what it costs out here) for a ONE bedroom apartment, The Fillmore Center simply says ""That´s what the SF market rate is and if you don´t like it, maybe you should consider moving out?!"" Wow, a big switch from five years ago when they were offering ""Incentives"" and free rent just to get this bankrupt apartment complex 60% rented.  Bottom line is: There have been reports of dangerous and illegal activities happening there. They will screw you with high rents after you´ve decided to make it your home.

12/16/2017,43085,1.0,"Two years ago, I toured about a dozen apartment buildings in the area, and I was thrilled to have stumbled upon Block 17. The staff back then was amazing, and we LOVED the building. The rooftop was beautiful, the staff threw great events and we happily renewed our lease after the first year. 

Shortly after that though, things began to change. As our fellow neighbors began moving out, we started to notice lock boxes on the doors in our hallway. We shrugged it off at first, but then we started noticing guests with suitcases coming and going from the units. They said they were booking short-term stays through stayalfred.com (similar to Airbnb). Now, don't get me wrong -- I love booking vacation rental homes as much as the next person -- but things get tiresome when almost every unit on your floor is operating like a hotel. On a regular basis, Stay Alfred guests would ask us to help them scan into the building, scan onto their floor, direct them on how to get to the roof, etc. We felt like hotel concierges, not actual rent-paying residents of an apartment building. 

On top of that, these guests ruined the sense of safety and community that we had within the building. We were constantly disrupted by noisy guests staying in the units that surrounded ours. (Loud bachelor parties and wedding parties were the norm.) One Saturday afternoon, in broad daylight, we walked through the courtyard to find that two gentlemen had thrown up on themselves and had passed out on the community chairs (right outside of the leasing office entrance). When we addressed this with the building staff and expressed our concerns, they said it was OUR responsibility to report all violations and that they were within their legal rights to rent out the units to Stay Alfred. The actual response from the previous manager, Andrea: ""Everything is being done legally and according to the landlord tenant, fair housing laws."" (Pretty defensive, no?). 

The management staff offered to waive the transfer fee if we wanted to move to another unit, but frankly ... we loved our actual unit. It was the practices within the building that were driving us crazy. Ultimately, we decided to wait it out and move when our lease was up, and we've been happy ever since.

After waiting 15 months, we were contacted by a leasing consultant, she asked if we were still interested moving in, as we were next on the list.  I was so excited!  This was perfect timing, my lease was due to expire and it was also going to lower my rent by $400 a month!
We were asked to bring in our most recent pay stubs and come to the rental office, which we did only to be told that our rent was no longer $889, but over $1000.  Our move in date went from Jam 4 to Jan 30!  This was announced by a different leasing agent from across the hall and AFTER giving our notice to vacate the property were we were living.  NOW WE HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE!
The two agents obviously had a clear distain for one another and it was a very uncomfortable situation for us.
I contacted Manager, Mr.Mauldin, who said he would look into the matter and call me back, 3 weeks later, I'm still waiting on Mr. Maudlin's call.
It could be that they have so many people on their waiting list that they are NOT CONCERNED that we had no place to live!
If this is how they conduct their daily business, perhaps it's a blessing that we didn't move in.
They are so unprofessional and petty amongst themselves, how would they treat tenants?
Mr.Mauldin had NO CONCERN that my 83 yo mother and I had no place to live at this point.
This lack of knowledge as to what is going on within their own office and lack of sympathy, we didn't even receive an apology, speaks volumes about those who are supposedly running this complex.
So....after frantically searching for a place to live, we are no better off than we were financially, we are worse!  Because of their MISTAKE, which was not a small matter, at least to us, we are in an apartment that is okay, but not what I would have chosen if I had time to look and research.

I myself am staying the the Philadelphia one bedroom which is almost 1100 square feet, super hard to find! 

But-Once you've gotten over the aw of fresh paint and new carpet, the reality of the age of this building shortly reveals itself. I've experienced 8-10 mice/rats in my apartment. I constantly listen to them biting at my walls at night, I wake up to bread eaten on my dining room table, droppings on my counter tops, and the occasional run-ins with the rodents in the hallway of my apartment. 
There where a lot of uncomfortable nights, home alone- listening to mice scratching in my radiator for hours. 

Now- What did management do?! 
Well, they sent the Orkin man 5-6times to spray.....and that was it! 

After my most recent uncomfortable run-in with Mickey Mouse, I finally went downstairs and asked Justin, why after all of my request-hasn't someone from maintenance come and filled a hole, found the problem, shut off the pathway, something?! And he's response was that, he wasn't sure. BUT! He took my name and apartment number down on one of his 20plus post it notes and promised a next day follow up....needless to say, I never heard back! 

So! This is my horror story with The Point! If you can handle rodents- then by all means, come and join the family! As for me...I'm running for the hills and hoping I don't pack none of these babies up on my quest to freedom.",1.0,Platinum,83.0,1.0,0.0

Coming from work and finding someone else in your spot is annoying.

Asking VITA to actually do something about it is even more annoying.

Parking violators aren't towed - they are given a letter on their windshield stating that they're in violating of the buildings parking policy.  After giving the violator the letter, they will only tow AFTER 3 DAYS have passed.

So say a different person parks in your assigned parking space every single day, you will never be able to actually park your car in the spot that you pay for.

- Rents are obscene - you pay a massive amount of money, and on top of that - they increase your rent every year by 20%. 
- You are literally surrounded by poo: The area immediately near the building and the surroundings is covered by human feces, garbage, human and animal piss and ... syringes and needles!
- Inside, it's the dirtiest building ever: The mail rooms have a permanent wet dog stench, as dog washing area never gets cleaned (only vacuum cleaned, but never properly cleaned). The gym floor has a tick layer of grime and hair, if you are doing yoga - good luck inhaling all that dirt. And people just throw garbage on the floor in the garbage rooms, and again - they never get cleaned for weeks. 
- Management are rude and entitled, they don't care about any of the residents and their well being. The only helpful staff are people who work the evening shifts and are in the tertiary leasing roles. 
- In the summer, the building becomes a hotel - because they lease out rooms to tourists and airbnb = Security? What security?

This past week I saw both the General Manager and Operations Manager, both stopped to say hello and have a brief conversation. It s nice that they know my name...especially in a large building. It s not a new 5 star building, but by no means is it a slum. There s a pool, a gym and a grocery store...among many amenities. If you get FedEx or UPS packages, they sign for them, and make it easy to pick up. Noise has been an issue for me in the past, but a few calls to security nixed that problem. I did have a small roach problem, but it was gone in 2 treatments from pest control. Even if there is a problem, it gets resolved, which does cut down on worrying! I think it s nice that the actual building manger is on premises. there really isn t a need to go above any ones head, or contact a higher up I don t think the Woodner is perfect, and will admit to having issues in the past, but would recommend moving in currently.

I pay alot of money for a worthless place. The neighborhood is sick, the air outside your window stinks so imagine if you decide to leave your windows open. By night fall do not even consider walking out if you do not want to die because it is not safe at all. The property itself is mismanaged because it is too big. The place actually constructed on an entire block in the middle of the neighborhood to clean up the place but the surrounding atmosphere is still there. The inside of the elevators smell exactly like the trash room and do not be decieved by how nice the place looks before you live in it because you later notice how the recycled bins are never emptied and nothing is ever cleaned. As for the management I wonder if they came from hell. Just because I am Asian one lady speaks to me like I do not speak any English. Hello? This is San Francisco! And the ppl in the office acts all nice before you sign the lease and when you do, forget it. Your leasing agent never returns any calls and there is a good chance you will get a lecture from someone in the security office if you ever need to go in there for a problem, and you will have to because go because they give you this stupid scanner key that never works so you find that you cannot get inside your own building like in the middle of the night or that you cannot get out of the garage when you have to be somewhere early in the morning. One time I had to actually park my car again and sit down and unscrew this metal poll so I could get to school on time since the scanner key was not working. If you want to recieve packages in the mail expect to make alot of trips across town to the actual UPS facility because you get charged $10 per item if the office holds it for you. Excuse me but this service is available for free at almost all other apartment buildings like the one I am moving to. There are also some questionable tenants. I got hit on by this old man the age of my grandfather who lives on my floor several times. He kept telling me I am beautiful and waited while I was unlocking my door for me to say something back to him. My poor roommate also started getting nightmares because of such ppl living in the building. The occupants in the room upstairs has loud disgusting bed shaking sex and I have to sleep through it. They also play the piano and my apartment sounds like a funeral home all evening. There was also this this huge ladder built right beside my window to do construction work without a single notice to my unit and the workers talk and scream to each other and pound away while I try to take a nap. I called the office to complain and the person I spoke to was not even aware of the existance of construction work and I finally gave up, hanged up the phone and went to a spa to sleep in the lounge there instead. You will never get your deposit back either so do not even think abt it. I could have lived in this fancy sky rise apartment building across town for the same price but it was too far away and I regret choosing this place. I am now moving across the street to another place that is super clean and has a swimming pool and free gym and although it is smaller it is not filthy like the gym that is here downstairs, which you have to get a seperate membership. I was only suppose to move next month but I am giving up a month's rent to my roommate so I can actually get out sooner.

I don't want to be unfair projecting an incomplete image. So here is what happened next:

After a 4 month long wait & a bitter Yelp review, we finally see a change! The property manager as promised arranged for & had the maintenance staff replace the gas range with one that has a digital display (as requested) & the washing machine combo unit replaced with a stack-able one (as requested). I am now happy with this. I am also
impressed with the maintenance staff. They are fast, hard-working, polite & funny. 

We learned it the hard way, if anything is broken in your apartment, take it directly to the management office at Coast. Don't bother calling or raising work orders as the decision has to come from the Management to see this through. Nothing right or wrong about it. Every company has their own management style, whatever works best for them. It's right as long as it works for the customers in the end.

The building is about 20 years overdue for renovation and you'll have to deal with roaches once in a while. In the spring, fruit flys swarm out of the water pipes are are very annoying. The aircon is centrally controlled so you have days when its way too cold or sweltering hot (and any complaints are met with a blank stare and no one seems to have any power to change it despite mass hysteria in the lobby by residents over the issue).

The air ducts aren't screwed into the walls because they ""didn't want to ruin the walls"". Every unit has free hanging skrews sticking out which isn't safe. The building uses Latch which is a horrible service. I don't even know how many times I've been locked out of the app or have had to stand there at the door and wait for it to connect. It's extremely annoying! There's no guest parking, not even for purchase, even though the building is maybe 50% full if that. Wouldn't make an exception for even one night. It's ridiculous. They used to offer water and have a Keurig in the communal space but took it away without providing any explanation. Do you want heat in the winter? Well you won't be able to count on that basic necessity here. During the polar vortex the heat stopped working in all of the units and it has been having issues ever since. A month later and still it hasn't been fixed. They handed out space heaters, which are fire hazards, to warm up our units and drive up our electrical bills. Management has been overriding the thermostats in all of the units for the past month so you don't have control over your own temperature. If you like your privacy you won't get it here. Since there have been so many heating issues management has been in and out of our units without authorization. Sometimes they enter your unit and you wouldn't even know about it. It's so disrespectful. This ""luxury new build"" is a complete failed experiment and we  are suffering for it. Management doesn't show any remorse and are impossible to get a hold of. They never pick up the phone or call back. The only time I was ever able to get through I had to rig the system and go through a leasing agent who was off-site and said they would text someone to get back to me. And of course the leasing agent picked up since they are so desperately trying to fill these vacant overpriced units. Renting here was a gigantic mistake and we are counting the days until our lease is up.",1.0,Certified,47.0,1.0,0.0

They always fixed anything that needed repair. I didn´t have any concerns about safety and felt comfortable walking around the neighborhood and my car was never bothered, either in the garage for 8 years or on the street for 1 year (well, one little scrape on the end of one bumper). I was generally able to find parking on the street and when I couldn´t, I could put it in the daily garage for $5/day. Parking generally freed up at the beginning and and at the end of the work day. Weekend parking was good too. I did get a 35% rent increase one year but my understanding is that they´re basically not raising rents if you sign a one year lease. The people in the office were always friendly and accommodating and I especially liked the feature where you could break your lease for $750. I moved to the East Bay to take advantage of a good deal but I miss living there. I got to know a lot of people on the free shuttle that goes downtown. I never had to buy a fast pass because of the shuttle. I do think the experience of living in the project is different at the northern end vs. the southern end. I think there are more security problems at the southern end. I would recommend this place if you´re not planning on staying for a long time.

NOT PROVIDED,NOT PROVIDED,1.0,"[u'\r\n                                Former resident here. My final take on AMLI SLU is that the $$$ price isn\'t justified. There is plenty of housing available in this area so do yourself a favor and steer clear of AMLI. They just don\'t care about their residents. Let me explain...\n\nThe building quality is shotty and there is no soundproofing between apartments or the outside. You hear every step and bark. Also, there is a bar down the block so if you\'re living on the south side of the building you will hear loud music and drunk people from 10pm-3am EVERY NIGHT because there is no insulation! The elevators are also ALWAYS out of service and are generally very slow.\n\nParking is TERRIBLE! You pay 175$ a month with no guarantee you\'ll actually get a spot. The spaces are so small that people take 2 because their cars literally don\'t fit. To make matters worse, half the spots are ""reserved,"" leased out to employees or those paying more for a better spot. Also, 3x while I lived there they blocked MORE spots to sell to businesses despite residents\' complaints about parking. Forget about parking in the reserved spaces when you can\'t find another spot because they ticket cars if not moved by 7am.\n\nCustomer service was always INCREDIBLY rude. Example: I moved in with my boyfriend (already living there) on a Friday. The front desk guy told me that I couldn\'t access the parking until the owner approved my application on Monday. Monday comes and I don\'t hear a peep so I end up paying the 20$ to street park. Tuesday morning I go down to see what\'s up and am told the owner was busy and hadn\'t gotten to it. Fine. I was furious by Thursday after still not being given access so I marched downstairs and demanded it. That SAME front desk guy ends up giving me a key to the garage despite the fact that I hadn\'t been approved yet. WHY COULDN\'T HE HAVE DONE THE WEEK EARLIER BEFORE I PAID 20$ A DAY FOR STREET PARKING??? Top it off with the fact that the employees are rude and unhelpful. When they say they open at 9 they really mean they\'ll walk in at 9 and talk to each other until 10 despite the line of people waiting. Also, they\'ll never be able to help, so they\'ll tell you they\'ll call later with the answer. Spoiler alert: you\'ll never get that call.\n\nAfter living there a year they will jack up your rent by 20% and  refuse to negotiate with you despite listing your same apartment for 100  less than they offered you. They charge those renewing their lease WAY more than other places so beware and do your homework.\r\n                            ']",1.0,Silver,51.0,1.0,0.0

7/12/2016,42563,4.0,"I wrote a pretty negative review a few weeks ago around some of the anecdotal problems I had while living here (which was 03/2015-03/2016 - the date's important as I'll reference below). While the problems were obvious and seemed to add up, the way the new management company handled the situation was nothing less but stellar (they took over halfway or so through my lease).

Essentially, I expected a slumlord style response - ""yea sorry, but whatever"", especially since the rental market in Boston is so building/landlord friendly with a large population. 

Instead, I received an extremely empathetic response that was apologetic and took the time to explain why things worked out the way they did and how they were solving things not only with the building, but also with their processes. The best part is that this didn't come off as an excuse, but rather as ""we know there were problems...many of them related to the old management company...we've fixed a lot of them, and are fixing the rest of them.""

For example, my issue with charges was because of some oversight the old management company made with leases. While the new company essentially ""bought"" the leases, their practices were a bit different, which caused confusion and tension with the new company.

Transitions are exceptionally difficult, especially when it comes to a building. I get that, and while I have a low tolerance for the stuff that happened to me, it takes a lot of courage and grit to openly recognize a problem and then put in some work to fix it globally and to make it right with the individual impacted. 

Based on how they handled this, I'm confident enough that the existing kinks have already been worked out and likely the rest will be amended in the near future. To give further context, they handled this so well, we're putting them on our list to contact for an apartment this fall. Thoroughly impressed.",1.0,Gold,64.0,4.0,1.0

On the day of moving i went to pick up keys and they told me that there is no final signature and the manager is off and doesn't answer his phone!! 2 hours later we got keys. In our new apartment there was still maintenance working and fixing some stuff. We notice that heat unit is not working( its Friday so if they don't fix we out of heat for a weekend), told the maintenance guy who was working in our apartment he told us to call office, we did , after 2 hours no one show up . We try to call again nobody answer, we called leasing office and maintenance, Yey someone answered and we explain the cord is burn down and we cant plug in because it is a fire hazard ( it was melted to carpet) they start arguing with us and told us to plug in anyway and if its fire to call 911 ! Can you believe that. This guy on phone keep arguing on the end he told my husband that they will not fix it. 30 min later he calls again and start yelling at me. WTF.

2. New-The lobby area and design is aesthetically pleasing & the finishes in the apartments are as well. 

3. Indoor parking-we struggled to find other places in Columbia that offered indoor parking. This was great to have.

4. Anthony in the leasing office is very pleasant to work with and the maintenance staff respond quickly.

Cons:
1. Other residents-there were constantly little kids running around unsupervised in the common areas and in the hallway. It really ruined being able to use the pool and hanging out downstairs.

2.Fire alarms-go off constantly and are so so so loud. As someone with a newborn, we hated living here for this reason. 

3. Security-the main door is open during office hours and anyone can access the elevator and come up to your floor. 

4. Thin walls-we could hear everything our neighbors were doing/saying. Also if you overlook one of the courtyards, the lights and music are on 24/7 so check before you pick your apartment. 

We also had an issue with our car being towed when it was parked legally behind the gate with our parking permit displayed. The leasing manager told us she could not do anything about it since the towing company was not authorized to tow in Howard County. However, the management let them behind the locked gates to tow and our car had a permit displayed. Our car was towed to downtown Baltimore, my husband missed work, and had to pay the towing fee and the cab fare and the management took no ownership.

OH BUT THE ROOF. Let me tell you about the roof. When you first visit the room your first reaction will be ""damn I can't believe I can afford to live in a place with such a kick ass roof.""

NOT PROVIDED,NOT PROVIDED,1.0,"[u'\r\n                                No single review can be truly objective or holistically capture the essence of a place or community. Keeping this in mind, I\'ve lived at the Apollo for multiple years in multiple units, and have interacted with nearly all of the staff who have came and left over the years. \n\nThe good: Although eclectic bordering on indiscriminate, the interior design of the building is unique, but conveys a significant effort. Unlike most mixed-use buildings, the Apollo tries to deliver a more authentic personality and ambiance, which is appreciated. The long serving staff of the building are generally wonderful people, notably the maintenance workers, Michael from leasing, and a host of concierges over the last few years. \n\nThe bad: As can be expected from a community of this nature from Bozzuto (or any similar company), the Apollo is a gilded monolith of corporate greed and mismanagement. As one of our favorite maintenance workers described it best: ""there was not a corner that was not cut in this building [on how low the building quality was]."" In the last two years the following maintenance issues come to mind: our dishwasher exploded (while sitting idle - this required the entire floor to be replaced), our microwave stopped functioning and had to be replaced twice, the air conditioning in the unit stopped working 5-10 times in a year, the air conditioning in the gym did not work for close to 9 months including the middle of summer. The electrical wiring in the unit was so ill-designed, that when certain outlets were in use, others would automatically trip the breaker. This affected every room of the apartment and was resolved within only a few months and included multiple weeks with exposed holes and electrical wiring in our walls. Amenities were kept up apathetically, with multiple stretches where there would be no pool cues, grills wouldn\'t work, etc. Normally this is expected, but for an additional $600 amenity fee a year it\'s reasonable to expect the AC in the gym to be fixed within the same calendar year. \n\nThe Ugly: Dishonest management, threatened, intimidated, acted abhorrently. 0/10\r\n                            ']",1.0,Gold,63.0,1.0,0.0

6/22/2015,42177,3.0,"I lived at The Kensington for a year between 2014 and 2015.

The apartments themselves are very nice and comfortable, and all the appliances worked well. The common spaces were also nice--good places to work during the day if you work from home and don't like to stay in the apartment. I didn't personally use the pool, grill, kitchen or pool table much but it seemed like people enjoyed those things as well. It was also fun to see the many dogs in the building. The neighborhood is really interesting and there are tons of great restaurants, bakeries and markets nearby as well as public transportation to take you anywhere you need to go in Boston.

The front desk staff (concierges, doormen) and maintenance staff members were really great. Really nice, welcoming, professional and efficient. The management office staff less so.

While there weren't bad problems with noise in our apartment, we could hear people in heels walking on floors a lot (don't know if it was above or next door). Weekend nights would always bring shrieking and giggling and running and door slamming in the hallways any time from 11pm to 3am, and I often had to put in earplugs. Again, this was not terrible just part of apartment living, but still annoying. Perhaps on a related note, it seemed like most people living in the building were in their 20s, although there were some families with young kids and a few older people too.

Probably the biggest issue I had with the building was that there seemed to be many vacation rental situations (along the lines of Airbnb) which meant that the building felt like a hotel despite efforts on the part of the staff to make it feel like a community, and it seemed that the front desk staff were often busy checking people in and out as if they were the front desk of a hotel. Some people, i.e., me, don't like to live in a building where many residents don't have a stake in its long-term condition.

11/12/2001,37207,1.0,"For some reason, my previous review of The Fillmore Center is no longer in the database. Listen Elkor: my documented, valid criticism of The Fillmore Center will not be silenced, so here is my review again.  We leased an apartment from The Fillmore Center for the period of 1994-2000. The only reason we stayed so long is because we had nice views from the penthouse apartment and because we hate to move. As everyone else says about TFC, when we moved in our leasing agent K*ren was sweet and nice and loveable, but the moment the lease was signed she never spoke to us again. I once left a string of thirty-seven telephone messages for her and she DID NOT RETURN EVEN ONE OF THEM. I had to walk in to the management office in person and start yelling at the lazy b*tches and they finally jumped up and were helpful as Hell. Here is a list of the most substantial roadblocks to well-being that we encountered during our time in TFC:  1) THE IRISH STUDENTS - What boneheaded manager decided to host college students in TFC for the summer? They were loud, obnoxious, and annoying, pounding on walls, yelling and screaming like monkeys, playing loud music all night long. It was a nightmare for three months with vague promises from the management that they ""would take care of it."" Of course, three months of complaints later, the noise stopped, but that´s because the students finally left.  2) THE CRIME - The western addition is not a place to live for decent, hardworking people. There are regular shootings, some of them inside the walls of TFC itself. I walked into the lobby one day to find yellow ""caution"" tape all over the place and bullet holes in the sheetrock. Nice. You really don´t want to walk in that neighborhood, even during the day. Parking in the underground lot is REALLY an adventure. People key your car, steal your air valve covers from your tires, smash your windows. Wow, great security, especially since the garage door breaks regularly and angry street people can simply walk in and vandalize your car or urinate in the garage. Speaking of security, the ""courtesy patrol"" (snicker) is a living joke: fat, lazy, do-nothings who are absolutely unhelpful and far from ""courteous"". TFC is located among several housing projects stretching as far as the eye can see, and there are regular shootings and associated police zooming through to catch the perpetrators. Have you ever lived in a place where a bunch of police walked through the grounds looking for a killer?  3) THE ROOF - Where to begin? Our ceiling leaked for six years, despite a multi-million dollar effort to repair errors made by lazy, expensive, unaccountable union labor who built the thing in the first place. I came home one day to find a water leak right above my bed. Right above my bed, dripping on my mattress. Can you imagine that? Every time it rained, hey, run for the pots and pans. All this for $2,500 per month. My repeated requests to the front office to change the moldy carpet were met with cold silence. I would bet a million dollars that they neglected to tell the new tenants that the roof leaks; they didn´t bother to tell us.  4) THE MANAGEMENT - Don´t get me started, just don´t. In a nutshell: the management are awful. If you move here, don´t expect them to help you out with anything at all, to listen to your complaints, return your phone calls, or make life just the littlest bit easier for you. Example: I was once locked out of my apartment and I had to run back and forth from engineering, the front office, and ""key control"" eight times until someone would let me back in. Now, if they really wanted to be incompetent, they would have let me run back and forth forty or fifty times. Here´s another example: I went on vacation a couple of years ago and my pet sitter kept sending me emails saying that they were going to tow away my car. It seems that the idiotic, stupid, ------- parking control mule would not allow me to use the old parking sticker (of course, I never received notice that we were supposed to get a new one). My pet sitter was hysterical. When I got back, I marched right down to the front office and screamed at everyone and boy howdy did you ever see such a sweet bunch of people! The only way you get things is by walking into the office and yelling. If you complain about the thirty-percent rent increase, they haughitly say ""it´s market rate"" and if you don´t like it, go somewhere else. Let´s put it this way: you´ll never become close friends with anyone in the front office, especially that fat c**t, if she´s still there.  5) THE LAUNDRY - Oh, the laundry, god the laundry. Where do I begin? I had clothes stolen regularly from the laundry room, and some mean-spirited pr*ck poured bleach in my colors one day. The low-income people living in the building (tower 2) especially loved to steal my towels. Sometimes all the washers are going and a bunch of neighborhood women are standing around in there, and you know they don´t live in TFC but just do their laundry there. Sometimes people will open your dryer door just to stop your clothes from drying, and sometimes they will remove your wet clothes from the dryer and leave them on the counter. Really ------- polite neighbors.  6) THE ELEVATORS - Okay, two elevators to serve nineteen floors of people, I guess that´s adequate. However, there is regularly only one working elevator, and sometimes neither one works. The elevators smell like urine, vomit, and other strange substances. You´re afraid to touch the buttons because sometimes angry low-income people spit on them. Anyone can walk into the building with you, so if three thugs get into the elevator with you, jump out right away and take the next one.  7)MAINTENANCE - Someone left a big pile of broken glass in the middle of the garage and there wasn´t any way to drive around it. I called the front office eight times to get it cleaned up, but it just sat there for a week, slowly getting dispersed by the garage traffic. I finally walked into the front office and told them that I was afraid the glass would puncture my tires, ""WOULD YOU PLEASE CLEAN IT UP?"". The guy in the office, who was some sort of tire expert, said that he doubted the glass would puncture my tires. As far as I know, the glass is still there.  8) TELEVISION - Cable TV picture is absolute crap. Difficult to see and fuzzy as hell. The cable company charges full price for this privilege.  In all fairness, I have to say that the appliances worked very well and in six years we didn´t have any problems with the oven, dishwasher, refrigerator, garbage disposal, or microwave oven. Also, the engineering department, while prompt in repairs (one of our toilets leaked), does not return phone calls unless you leave a minimum of three messages. We both noticed that the only conscientious, thoughtful, considerate employees to work there during our stay didn´t last very long. One was a leasing agent with a heart of gold who returned EVERY phone call and listened to our problems. *POOF*, she was gone in a month. Another was a maintenance worker who always smiled and said: ""good morning"" and talked to the tenants like they were real people; *POOF*, he lasted three weeks. What does that tell you? TFC wants to only hire cold, stuck-up, incompetent people who don´t care about anything but taking your check every month.  SUMMARY: Take it from me, you really do not want to live in TFC. It´s not a place for normal people to live. You cannot make a home for yourself in a place with high crime, terrible management, unrestrained rent increases, poor cable, and -------- downtown shuttle service, which is absolutely useless when it fills up (they won´t run multiple buses). If you´re looking for a place to live in San Francisco, I strongly advise you to stay away from this awful place and find an apartment in a smaller building or maybe a condo in Diamond Heights or Twin Peaks.",0.0,Non-Certified,45.0,0.0,0.0

This wouldn't be any issue if the loads were large but they aren't. Load spaces are very small and you have to use their service if you are in the towers. 3. The management office sucks ---. They dont use email! They post notices up on a bulletin board or stick a letter under your door; all paper. They don't have any management people living in the apartments which is a big sign that they are detached from what the issues are in the building. 4. Since there is no 24/7 management(only working hours M-F 8-5), locking yourself out is a big issue! The charge an absurd amount for a locksmith to come out. And initially, you wouldn't think locking yourself out wouldn't be an issue but the locking mechanism isn't the same as most doors. 5. Parking is an issue.

The underground garage was a huge selling point for me and continues to be with all the winter weather. The installed security here is unmatched. You need a garage pass to get into the garage and then a key fob to get into the building from there. I've never had anyone walk through the front door to come see me (they have to be let in by the concierge) without getting a call first from the front desk. The gym is actually state of the art. Most folks will never need a gym membership...our gym is that great. The veranda is gorgeous. It's very well kept in the summertime and a lovely place to just relax. 

The management and staff: they would give you the shirt off their backs to make you a happy customer. The property manager is one of the kindest people I've ever even met, I would follow her to any community she manages. 

Keep in mind reading these reviews that the management and community managers cannot help the behaviors of its residents. Yes, I've seen and met some pretty ridiculous, inappropriate, rude people who live here, but I've come to see that's pretty standard for Arundel Mills. It is not an accurate reflection whatsoever on the community! Given the option, I would choose The Palisades every day and twice on Sunday.",1.0,Certified,43.0,5.0,1.0

Pros -New building -Concrete Floors -Pretty solid amenities -Generally nice staff Cons -Having visitors is difficult when you don't know that they'll have a spot to park. When we first moved in we were told that there would always be plenty of visitor parking, but as time has progressed they've been selling off more and more of those visitor spots to the point that it's nearly impossible to ensure that your guest will be able to park anywhere near the building. Their suggested solution has been to have our guests park at the metro parking deck (at the cost of 4.85 per person) which is also a good 5-10 minute walk from the building. -Front doors to apartments don't insulate noise very well, so you hear everything from the hallway constantly. -The ""smoke free"" designation only applies when the residents decide not to smoke.

11/8/2008,39760,3.0,"The Good: It is almost impossible to find an affordable modern building for an apartment in the metro Boston area. After living a few three-story ""family homes"" run by virtual slum lords, it was nice to find an apartment where I was was the first person to live in it, a dishwasher, central air/heat, and decently thick walls where I can't hear my neighbors and they can't hear me. The O.k.: The sound proofing is pretty good between apartment, but you can hear EVERYTHING going on in the hallways. The gym is tiny, as others say; but you know that before you sign the lease. The parking is limited and the spaces are VERY small. If you have an SUV parking next to you, then you will not be able to open your door. Many reviews have complained about the number of students who live here. What kind of idiot moves across the street from UMass and doesn't expect there to be a lot of students living in the building. The staff, I'm told, is trying to be better by putting students on certain floor and professionals on certain floor; but I don't see evidence of it. In stead of having more expensive apartments be a deterrent, it's usually an excuse for 3 or 4 students to split a 2 bedroom. I have never had to make a noise complaint. Sometimes I can faintly hear TV/music from the outside in my living room, but never in my bedroom and never so loud that I can't block it out with the A/C unit fan. Talking to people on other levels, they have varying degrees of experience ranging from similar to much worse, mostly depending on who next door and up stairs neighbors are. They say there is no direct line to call to make noise complaints, and when they do find someone, complaints often go unheeded. Yes, this is a Dorchester address, but I have never felt unsafe walking home in the dark (drunk) at 1 in the morning. This isn't the Fields Corner or Dot Ave area, this is where the JFK library is. It's mostly a college area, with some low-income housing near by. It's very nice low-income housing, though. Once I walked by the thugs who like to hang out at a near-by bus stop. They made a few jokes at my expense, I laughed, and walked on. In 9 months, that's been it. The bad: Though one does have to expect students living across from Umass, many of these students are not told that they have to grow up if they want to live outside a dormitory. I expected that there would be a party now and then, but almost every morning (especially on weekends) there are beer cans, spills, and bodily fluids left all over the apartment building. I feel sorry for the really friendly custodian who has to clean up after all of these ingrates. The staff changes consistently. It varies from friendly and frustrated that they can't help, friendly and useless, and unfriendly and incompetent. Going directly to the management company is pointless. Many promises are not kept, especially things told to you when you move in (like how the construction of the new building ""will not start before 8:00 any morning"", it ""will not block the view of anyone above the sixth floor"", there is a ""free shuttle to take you to the t-stop"", ""buses come by frequently"", etc.). Several consistent maintenance issues include: security systems to let people in the building not working, elevators breaking/getting stuck, fire alarms going off for hours on end, power going off for hours on end (sometimes requiring a noisy generator outside the building), broken/not cleaning washers and dryers, washers and dryers that make so much noise that they shake all nearby apartments, consistent problems with apartment an building heating/air conditioning. The pool is RARELY open, and (most annoyingly) adults are not allowed access without a lifeguard. All it would take is a sign that says, ""Warning: No one under 18 when no lifeguard is on duty"". The fools who designed the building put the pool on the side that gives it the least amount of sun. Location: Without a car, living here can be a pain. The 1/2 mile to the T/store seems A LOT longer when the rain and snow come. There is NOTHING out here. No convenient restaurants, no store you can drop in to. Nothing. The best you can do is drop into the Au Ban Pain in the Double Tree Hotel for a microwaved snack if you don't feel like cooking some night. There is a lot of awful Chinese and pretty greasy Italian that deliver. The 8 and 16 buses to the T stop inconsistent at best. There are 15 number 1 and 2 buses that go by while waiting for the 8 and 16, and they WILL NOT STOP. Cab rides from downtown if you miss the T can be $15-20, and $40 coming from Cambridge. That means most nights out on the town you have to plan to leave by 12:00, because the stupid MBTA can't figure out that people who actually want to enjoy the city need transportation until 3:00 a.m. If you do have a car, the parking spaces are small. Indoor or outdoor, you will get dinged. Guest parking spots are virtually nonexistent. Don't even think of having people over if it is during the school year. Overall, it's a mixed bag. The place is new and clean, and I love having a dishwasher and central air/heat (when it works). The location can be a pain if you don't have a car or if you like to go out a lot to different parts of the city. Considering a similar apartment would run $1700 downtown, it's not too bad. I know they charge varying rates for these apartments, but paying any more than $1250 for the inconvenience of this location would be downright ridiculous.

It smells like breakfast here--the air is slightly sweet, which some people may not like, but we enjoyed.  Think of it as enjoying a freshly baked cinnamon roll without ingesting a thousand plus calories.

The menu is old fashioned and well used (the illustration of a nuclear family enjoying a meal together would have been dated in the 1970s, but it perfectly fits the nostalgic charm of this place). Even though the menu holder was well used, it wasn't dirty.  

We enjoyed the extensive choices on the menu and we were amused by the fact that no substitutions are allowed.  Nothing is gluten-free, egg free, dairy free, or touted as organic, which is surprising given the food climate of this region.  Yet, it was busy here on a Friday morning at 10:30.  

I like to think of this genre of restaurants as ""high, low quality:"" thick, buttery pancakes; plentiful imitation maple syrup and perfectly prepared link sausages.  The non fresh squeezed orange juice was a 16 ounce concoction that paired perfected with the sausage.

With that said... a few years ago new management took over. Since that time, our rent has gone up every year (about $150 in 3 years). Additionally, this new management is just horrible! Example 1: - March: water pipe on roof broke. Flooded most apartments on west side of building - Today - August 18 (yes, that is 5 months later) they are just now STARTING to get the place cleaned up... some wallpaper is hung on SOME floors... though new carpeting has still not been laid... and they have (literally) stopped vacuuming the old carpeting - the place is an absolute mess! Disgusting! For five months, they have left us paying $1600 (minimum) rent to live in absolute squalor. It is EXTREMELY disgusting! Example 2: New management came in - closed the gym for a week to do 'repairs'. They did paint the walls (one of the worst colors of brown that I have ever seen) -- but did NOT fix ANY of the machines that were broken! Example 3: after three years the new management team does not even know our names! (A Marketing 101 class would surely teach them that pleasing customers/tenants is a must... after all, it is far easier to keep loyal customers than it is to keep acquiring new ones).

If you like paying tons of money a month for nothing, this is the place for you. Construction materials used are of poor quality and the floors already creek when you walk on them. 'Supposedly' they installed sound proofing between floors. What they installed is some material that takes your footstep and spreads it out over the entire floor creating a deep thud sound. The gym is conveniently located directly below resident apartments and adjacent to the quiet study area. The trash shoot is located directly on the other side of the bedroom of the one bedroom apartment plan. The fire alarm will go off randomly, as the complex is 'still under construction'. There are no signs in the hall indicated the safest escape route. In the fall they re-filled the pool and let algae grow in it for the last few months. The sensor for the parking garage gate works sometimes. Some days the gate is left completely up and random people will bring their car/truck into the resident parking lot and leave them there for months. The electric charging stations they advertise don't actually work. The concierge is available about 50% of the time. The social events they throw consist of five small jars of candy, which ran out in 10 minutes and a bunch of random people standing around. If you like hearing the footsteps of every person in your hallway and the people above you, listening to weights crashing all day, hearing trash fall down the shoot all day, having your ears blown out from file alarms once a week, looking outside your balcony at the disgusting green pool, parking your car in the Harris Teeter parking lot overnight, seeing abandoned vehicles in the lot you pay 50 dollars a month to park in, coming down 2-3 times to get your package, and attending awkward and poorly planned community events, this is the place for you.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

7/20/2014,41840,5.0,"We get to be the first review! Since we're the first ones reviewing a brand new apartment complex, and we've just started to live at Verde, we thought it would be fair to treat our review like a blog and provide updates every few weeks. We'll be as objective and fair as possible, and feel free to ask us any questions. Us: A fairly normal, professional couple in our late twenties with enough renting experience to write a half decent review. Prior to moving in (July 2014). Happiness so far: 9 out of 10. -First and foremost, the staff is friendly and helpful. They know most tenants by name. They are quick with information, and they feel like advocates for you, and not the apartment company. Craig is especially friendly, and has been nothing but patient and helpful with us as we asked a multitude of questions and hogged his time. Very satisfied with the staff. -The building: Brand new. Immaculate. The apartments surround a parking garage (offers uncovered parking on the roof or covered parking on the levels below for extra money per month). Some guest parking is available, and there is plenty of street parking in the adjacent housing community. Gym, fire pit, small swimming pool. Long hallways, painted lime green (meh). The building is green friendly, with solar panels on the roof. -The location: On one hand, it's located in a very convenient spot, located on Route 1, with ready access to 95, 100, 175, and 295, with nearby bus stops. On the other hand, it's directly adjacent to Route 1. We specifically chose an apartment on the opposite side if the building that overlooks a new townhouse community, and frankly, we would not have chose Verde if the only available apartments were the ones facing Route 1. That view is as non-scenic as it is noisy. Combined with air traffic from nearby BWI, there is a big contrast between the apartments the different sides of the building. Make an informed decision before you choose an apartment overlooking Route 1. The immediate surrounding areas are less than ideal. Next to a gas station, near the intersection of 175 and 1, and no inviting retail within walking distance. That's not to say we don't feel safe there; we do. It's just not an especially hip place to live. -The apartment: Seems nice enough so far, especially for the price. We caught a special at the right time, so we pay around $1700 a month for one of the smaller 2 bed/2 baths. Part carpet, part cheap hardwood. Plentiful cabinets. New appliances, although the washer dryer is not full size. Electric stove. Ample cable jacks for Comcast or Verizon service. Good closet space. Ours has a balcony, though not all do. It's a standard, cookie cutter, modern apartment. We simply haven't spent enough time in ours yet to give a great picture of what it's like yet, but we'll provide updates as we go.

The pool was spectacular. Often though, parties during the summer would get a little rowdy, with more strangers/guests than residents frequenting the pool and rooftop space, and management never seemed to care, often to the chagrin of residents trying to enjoy the common areas. The gym definitely left something to be desired, and was small with outdated equipment. 

My MAJOR quip is with the management of this complex, that seems to turn over constantly. I moved out in November 2017, and was told by the then manager that I would be receiving my security deposit, in full, mailed to my new address. It is now APRIL, and I have yet to receive my reimbursement. I have made calls ad infinitum to follow up on this, yet I am passed around from one ""manager"" to another, who promises to look into it, with no results.

The moving in process was pretty good and the leasing office and front desk were really helpful and responsive. They allow you to view your apartment to take measurements and pictures as often as you like. We did have one issue with parking but was able to solve it with the manager. They give you nice welcome gifts the day you move in. The building is always clean and I love that we have access to retrieving our packages whenever we can since the front desk is 24/7. The location is also PERFECT! Maintenance is really good and professional, I haven't had any issues. Once you call the front desk, they create a maintenance ticket immediately and you're notified. I'm confused about some of the comments about the safety here, there's someone at the front desk at all hours of the day and I've never seen anything threatening. The front desk is always respectful, for the most part I'm greeted but I don't expect them to say hi to every last person that walks through the door. I'm hoping some of those negative reviews aren't based off someone's race.

It certainly isn't for the apartments! They are significantly smaller than others in the same price range, with outdated kitchens and bad paint jobs. In addition, management is now changing pricing weekly, to take advantage of Silver Spring's popularity (I tried to change apartments). In the office, deal with Doug S. I've found other personnel provide misleading and incorrect information. For example, I've been quoted a significantly incorrect square footage, and told that the complex was full (announced loudly for knowledge of potential renters), when an apartment next door to me has been vacant for at least a month.

Honey, I'm home!! 
I like luxury lifestyle and the finer things in life, who doesn't right? But I'm not greedy, I'll settle for a 1 bedroom instead of the penthouse. (Haha!)
This place is absolutely breathtaking.

Tonight, I kind of felt like Julia Roberts as Vivian in  Pretty Women. I didn't get to have a  bubble bath in that tub or get to jump up and down on the bed, but I did see the beautiful view and experience all the amenities including laying in the cabana and star gazing by the pool. 

These apartments features everything lavish and luxury in their studio $3,000 and up, one bedroom $5,000 and up, two bedroom $6500. The 2 bedroom Penthouse  is at $14,000- $17,000 furnished. These luxury apartments features  upscale, exquisite design and top of the line quality and comes with  an city view of Los Angeles. The rooms are spacious with a walk in closet, the bathroom has a bath tub and a stand up shower.  The design is sleek and contemporary. 

Parking structure is below the building, walking in, you are greeted by concierge and in the lobby a Nepresso coffee machine to help you start your day or end your night. 

The residents here gets to enjoy the extravagant amenities such as a club house use for a party or a get together that has a kitchen and sick right next to the outdoor barbeques. There is also a work from home space.  A conference room that can hold business meetings. 

There's a fitness center on the facility with quality brand workout equipments.  The Sky Deck with rooftop pool is just breathtaking. I would definitely enjoy a nice swim here with an amazing view and then get comfy at one of the cabana.  They have and even butlers for the Penthouse residents.

It is minutes from the Grove, and all the trendiest shopping and restaurants are located at.

Also if you read the other reviews by people here you'll see one review from this building, which I just reported to Yelp for hate speech, calling employees illegal immigrants because they're Hispanic and called another employee an offensive and derogatory term for LGBT.  I now no longer feel safe with people that are racist and homophobic living in this building and talk like that openly. 

This is the most ridiculous place I've ever called home, so much so it has caused us to actually go buy a house which we move into later this month....yep, never renting again after this experience. Paying over $4k a month for this crap is coming to an end! 

The building is gorgeous but WOW the amount of college kids or people that do not care about property or the rules. Lots of parties and drunk people in the elevators that have no respect for themselves, neighbors, the building and employees or personal space. Constant emails from management reminding people of the rules and etiquette sums it up pretty well that most of the people here just do NOT care. And on any holiday that involves excessive drinking, best believe this building turns into a complete frat and sorority house. 

Apartments are nice except for the cheap bathroom cabinetry and tiny living rooms and the fact you can hear right through neighboring walls and floors, we can hear when neighbors are lifting their blinds as if they're in the room with us.  And the smells of neighbors cooking always comes through our guest room and guest bathroom... Can't tell if it's coming from next door, upstairs or downstairs ...but I know they use a lot of garlic and onions!!! 

Don't even think about using amenities as it's always overrun by guests that don't even live here and constant rule breaking and overcrowded. 

The dog park is a nightmare, we toured the building July 2017 when it was still under construction, we were told by leasing that the dog park would be on the rooftop of 5th floor... That clearly didn't happen! We felt lied to after we signed lease and moved in because the dog park since moved into the alleyway behind building and right next to a nightclub, so don't even think about taking dogs out after midnight because the amount of drunk people loitering right next to and around the dog park is insane... And don't get me started on how many times myself or my dogs have almost been run over by cars speeding through alley, you can't see behind the door when you open.  Also non residents can break into dog park anytime because you can actually reach over and open the handle from the inside to let you in, I've witnessed it myself! It's a joke! Hardly anyone picks up their dogs poop, poor maintenence team is left to do it. I've personally had to clean up after these ridiculous and lazy residents so that our dogs can actually play. There's no excuse for it, don't own a dog if you can't clean up after it ...I'd hate to see what their apartments look like!! 

Katrina in concierge is basically the only thing good around here. She's the best employee this place has...and the only concierge employee that is still here since we moved in last September.

On the other side, when there are issues (which inevitably arise with any rental property), some office workers can be extremely defensive. A couple individuals I knew actually had shouting arguments with members of the staff which I find incredibly unprofessional. SAFETY On the outside of these apartments, it seems safe. Key fobs to get in at every entrance, outside gates, outside doors and then sometimes inside doors and then your own door has two locks! Safety within, however, is another story which leads me to my next topic. CONSTRUCTION Though the high ceilings and very large rooms are a perk to this place, we learned from the start that everything is made with poor quality and lack of attention to detail. The day we moved in, our toilet paper dispenser fell off the wall and behind it, we could see that there were many holes from where someone tried to install it. That was our first clue about the sheet rock here. It will NOT hold things. Unless something is screwed straight into the stud, it will fall down. This was the only way we could keep our curtain rods up! Everything else fell down at some point in our stay. Then, about a month ago, I opened one of my cabinet doors and the entire cabinet came off the wall! Fortunately, there were only paper plates and cups inside. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have caught it and would have smashed my face in. I shudder to think if one of my children had opened the cabinet instead of me. Once the cabinet came out, I looked at the place it was held in. No anchors! A 30 lb. cabinet designed to hold even heavier things was being held up by two small screws that were not in a stud or anything. The maintenance crew fixed it quickly, but it is pretty alarming that it happened in the first place. QUALITY This is where all my low ratings come from. That maintenance guy is all over the place fixing things night and day because this brand new place is falling apart! As stated above, the sheet rock is junk, but in a few short months stay, we also had issues with our plumbing, carpet (apparently it was too much hassle for the builders to pick up loose nails and things before laying in the flooring? We could feel all kinds of weird things under the carpet), the door panels (one wide swing from my three-year-old son and the door stopper went straight through it), and the other mismatched hardware is just low quality. Be careful with the walls too! They're all painted in a flat light tone so EVERYTHING scratches and scuffs it. Just moving your stuff in will leave them looking awful. AMENITIES The pool is decent. It's tiny and nobody ever uses it so we basically had free reign. The only bugger is that it didn't open until noon and by then you only have a few hours before it's covered in shadow. Still, it's kept up and the (unnecessary) lifeguards are usually friendly. The gym is excellent with new machines and tvs attached to all of them. Again, barely anyone seems to use it so I usually have free reign when I'm there, even at peak exercising hours like 6-7 am or 7-8 pm. There are weight machines and a pulley system too, so its a nice set-up. MOVING OUT Forget good relationships with the staff. They will charge you up the wazoo for any and everything. Small stain in the entryway? $1700 to replace the ENTIRE apartment carpet. Marks on the walls? (You will have them because the paint is junk) Pay up! I don't know if this is building policy or affects someone's year-end bonus somewhere, but this was seriously an unimpressive way to end our stay. OVERVIEW Basically, I gave only one star because though I like the nice things around the apartment community, the general quality of the units is just not good and by the time you figure that out, it's too late. I hope some attention is put into fixing these major oversights before someone is seriously hurt.",0.0,Non-Certified,0.0,0.0,0.0

2 out of 4 elevators didn't work for two months! The management didn't make any effort to solve this problem. When we asked them if we can terminate our lease, the answer was no. Horrible two months.... especially if you have a dog. In the mornings or on Saturdays we were waiting for the elevator for at least 10 minutes. I actually saw the line of people which started from the lobby :)

We have a river view, which was really nice. But now we have a 'nice' view of a construction crane! I don't even want to mention how loud the construction is. 

There is a really nice small river walk behind the building. Nice place to walk your dog. We liked that there are no people there.  BUT! When it's snowing, the maintenance personnel put SO MUCH salt in that area. It's impossible to walk you dog. And my shoes were all in salt!  I just don't understand the point of this salt in the place where no one walks except for the residents. 

The grocery store is 15 minutes away. It is inconvenient for us as we don't have a car.

The exceptional yelp rating that this place has doesn't surprise me one bit. JUXT is amazing.

I've stayed at 4 pretty nice apartments in downtown Seattle, and this apartment complex is at the top of the list. This place is brand new and has awesome amenities: a well-stocked gym, arcade room, rooftop deck with great views of Lake Union and the Space Needle, huge lounges, free coffee, free happy hours, free kayak and paddleboard rentals (my favorite), and the list goes on and on. Everything is kept in really nice condition and the common areas are consistently cleaned. 

The apartment units themselves are top quality. The appliances are all brand new, and theres plenty of cabinet space to store a lot of things. I literally never hear my next-door neighbor and almost never hear neighbors above me. win win win.

All these things already make me a happy camper but something that I am so impressed by is the management. I never dreamed of having such helpful people, some of who are also residents in the complex themselves, be managers and admins of our apartment. I have literally never gotten a ""no"" from them. I'd try to list everyone's names to say good things, but then I'd list the whole team. They're great, and go out of their way to make things convenient and easy for you. top notch, 10/10, super-friendly-awesome team!!

One has to register visitor cars in an app but sometimes the app doesn't work and you have to be stress out that your guest's car doesn't booted or towed.  The parking rules seem to be driven with the idea of forcing tenants to pay for additional parking fees. We pay for one additional spot for my son's car and the towing company booted his car by mistake. I had to lend my car to him and miss an important meeting. The towing company will refuse to remove the boots unless they get paid. I had to wait for staff to arrive at 9am and to report their mistake to the staff and they called to request removal of the boot at 9am.  I had to return to the management after 11:30am to get them to once again call and have the boot removed. Great inconvenience and ""we are sorry"" doesn't fix all the inconvenience we had because someone made a mistake. Also the rules seem to change and evolve regardless of when you sign the lease. Have had packages lost and undelivered because there is not always someone by the door. There are new rules that limit guest visiting. No more than 2 guess can join you by the pool area (that's a new rule we didn't have when we signed the lease)  Your rent payments are due on the first.

Management keeps ""fixing"" the problem, but the only thing they´ve accomplished is prolonging how much hot water we get before it runs cold. They traced the issue to a bad heater, but instead of getting a new heater, they got a larger water tank to hold more hot water. It shouldn´t take three years to get hot water. Friends I had that knew people that lived in RPA the year before I moved in also had problems with water; so for at least four years RPA can´t get the hot water working.  My other major complaint is with the quality of the walls. There were holes in my walls next to the heat/ac, which meant I have no insulation. Maintenance caulked some of the holes, but didn´t check the unit itself which had the outside air vent set to on, so no matter how well insulated the space was, air from the outside would always get through the unit. I never bothered to call back to report this because I´m moving out and I´m so tired of dealing with these people.

However, under the shiny wrapping paper, lays a façade; a building and a regional manager (-----) that makes living at the Southmore a true nightmare not a luxury/safe haven. First, the building is not completely built which the management conveniently left out, thus the hallways are always covered with tons of construction junk and painted footprints. Second, elevators, especially the freight elevator, which is convenient for taking dogs down is perpetually not walking. The elevators look run down already. The freight elevator smells and the actual elevators the floors are always dirty. Third, the apartments are not sealed properly, that is you can hear a lot of noises that seep in from windows, patio doors, and doors that are not sealed. I can hear my neighbors TV and what show they are watching from down the hallway. Fourthly, the trash rooms are on each floor and there is sometimes the most awful smells wafting through the corridors. Fifthly, the building claims to be pet friendly but it is NOT. If you have dogs that bark don't go here. Further, the pet owners they do have their also are very lazy. They don't pick up after their dogs, and let their dogs of their leashes when other dogs are around. The neighboorhood sometimes has homeless people walking around and sometimes it doesn't feel safe in the early mornings and nights. Finally, half of the guests are very pretentious/ white-privileged sort of people who complain ALOT, who don't seem to work (they always in their apartment so don't make noise) and expect everyone to bow down to them. Three times as I was downstairs waiting for my parcels, I was asked by other tenants to get a package or if I was a dog walker when I had my dog with me. It is clear they think that only certain color of people can live in this building. They don't even tip the free valet guys for the free service. Finally, the regional manager, I believe is secretly racist and is very condescending. ----------------- once said ""there is a special place in h.. for women who don't help each other..."" she is all about appearance, extremely unreasonable and condescending when she talks to you. She fails to realize you're the client purchasing a product for a short time from her.

The worst part about Riverside, was the the calamity that happened during move-out inspection.The reason why I moved last year is detailed below. Submitted complaint to BBB, strangely enough, Aimco doesn't have any complaints on record, not sure if people are afraid, but you must file the complaint if you want something to be done. I lived here for two years and I will say, it was nice to live close to old town without paying an arm and a leg and the apartment was large almost 1000 sq ft. The reason for the low ratings score is because of move out inspection oh and they tried to raise my rent twice (they forgot they had already sent me a rent raise letter and sent another one). Yep, everyone who has moved out knows about the bad business practices of their management team to try to charge you for carpet stains! I knew this was coming, I wasn't expecting it to be sooo hard. I tried for months to come to some sort of agreement with Riverside/Aimco management, and even was working with Vanessa who seemed interested in resolving the matter. That was until I stopped hearing from them and here it comes, received a COLLECTION notice from some agency. Oh yes my friends, Riverside will do you dirty. So watch yourself on move out day, take pictures before and after you move in (I did) and better yet, don't move in. Also, about the community center gym facilities, if you do NOT live in building 1, you will need to pay $35/month or use the ok, but in badly need of a makeover building 3 gym. Can you believe it?

Pro: Great staff, although in recent month both the primary leasing consultant and staff has changed. Great maintenance - things have been fixed promptly and building overall well maintained Quiet - especially top floor where most people are a bit older. During the year only once, were there a crowd in the quad past 10pm. Apartment - seems bigger than surrounding apartment complexes Con: Change in staff - the assistant changed twice in 12 months that I was here Price - Rent does not include anything (water, trash, AC/Heat, etc.) Amenities - has only the basic (gym & indoor parking)..other buildings have morning breakfast, pool, larger community/media rooms, theater, community events Understaffed - feels like staff is constantly overworked and running against time to get things done (example: received my exit offer letter the day it was due, ideally should be given 30 days prior to due date to give resident a chance to really consider offer to stay) Pricing only seems to really want residents who can sign 1 year lease, anything less has penalty per month (surrounding buildings offer same rent for 6 months) Washer/dryer in unit smaller than standard size (can wash at most 2 towels at a time)",1.0,Silver,52.0,3.0,0.0

4/3/2004,38080,1.0,"Today we´re going to learn about corporate shills. Can you say ""shill""? Good for you!  Let´s start with this statement:  ""I’m one of those residents so suprised by these negative reviews.""  If you liked the fillmore center, why would you bother coming to this site to defend it?  ""I’ve lived at the Fillmore Center for a little over two years. I moved from another city, and I think finding this apartment was the single best thing that happened to me.""  Really? The single best thing that happened to you was moving into an overpriced dump? How pathetic her life must be.  ""First, they accepted my cat, which was a big thing to me.""  Most apartments accept cats.  ""Each one had a different layout. These apartments aren’t cut with the same cookie cutter.""  Complete and utter --------.  ""The unit I eventually chose has a huge, lovely balcony overlooking Fillmore Street. It’s especially wonderful during the Jazz Festival!""  And for hearing sirens, screaming people, buses, and getting clouds and clouds of dirt and exhaust in your apartment.  ""And aside from how much I like my apartment, I LOVE this neighborhood! Firstly, I´m a white, female yuppie type, but I really value the cultural diversity of the neighborhood.""  Notice the pathetic attempt to curry favor by ""demonstrating"" how ""safe"" it is for a single white woman to live here. By the way, ""cultural diversity"" means people screaming all night in the streets, urine in the elevators, funky low-riders cruising up and down Fillmore street blasting their rap music, filthy sidewalks, and, across the street, the scariest Safeway you´ve ever seen in your life. Here´s a tip, kids: any time someone mentions ""cultural diversity"", turn and run the other way as fast as you can.  ""I have NEVER felt threatened or endangered in this neighborhood.""  Obviously she never leaves her apartment.  ""I have never witnessed a crime.""  I never witnessed the rape in the garage. I guess that means it didn´t happen. The victim, the detective, and all those cops must have lied about it, I guess. Remember kids, if you don´t see it, it doesn´t exist!  ""I don’t own a car, so parking isn’t a problem.""  Duh!  ""Visitors have managed to find street parking, and building management once hooked me up with a temporary garage space for a few days for a guest staying me.""  BFD.  ""(Management has always been friendly and helpful.)""  See kids, this is what a bald-faced lie looks like. You can hear lies like this coming from the lips of politicans, car salesmen, and the management of the Fillmore Center.  ""I love the convenience of all the shops, and being the pretentious young yuppie I am, I love being able to walk up the street to the beautiful neighborhoods, restaurants, and window shopping of Pacific Heights, Cow Hollow, and the Marina--all of which I consider to be a part of my extended neighborhood.""  Then why doesn´t she claim to live in the Marina? Hey, I live in New Orleans, because I consider it to be a part of my extended neighborhood. Really kids, this is priceless!!!  ""Lastly, I love the different cool things that are just a part of being in the Fillmore neighborhood. The Jazz Fest and other street fairs, the free concerts, the farmers market, film screenings, etc.""  Just be sure to wear your bulletproof vest and never, ever go through the neighborhood unaccompanied.  ""I hope I don’t sound like some kind of corporate shill.""  DING! DING! DING! DING! DING! Kids, here´s an example of the worst kind of reverse psychology, by saying that something isn´t what it really is. That´s like saying ""George Bush isn´t the worst president in recent history.""

12/27/2017,43096,5.0,"I originally had an *extremely* long review, because I can't say enough about how fantastic Access Culver City is! I've tried my best to be more succinct. 

- The apartments themselves are phenomenal. We had a 2 br/bath. Brand new in-unit washer/dryer. Massive walk-in closets. Huge walk in bathrooms with large cabinets. Kitchen had tons of storage space, an island, new modern appliances (oven, fridge, microwave, dishwasher). Huge patio - could fit a table with chairs, a lounge chair, plants and still had space. 
- Very well kept. Clean hallways. Pool area, clubhouse, gym are all very nice, well decorated and clean. And it shocked me how quickly our maintenance issues were resolved. (Thank you Rick!)
- The pool, the hot tub and surrounding common areas are clutch. Lots of sun during the day. Also tons of seating, including a dining table. There are also two state-of-the-art grills.
- Ishma, the community manager, is absolutely wonderful. She has created an awesome sense of community with a number of fun festive events (ie. after-work cookouts, holiday brunches, etc.) and other features (ie. group fitness). She wants to make sure that tenants are happy and constantly asks for feedback. One prime example is when we happened to mention that I don't use the community Keurig because I only drink decaf coffee. Decaf coffee pods appeared the next day! 
- Maggie and Michael, leasing consultants, are very welcoming and also big contributors to the community. My roommate and I hit it off with Maggie the second she greeted us for our apt tour, and she's consistently been a warm face. 
- The tenants are awesome. Very friendly, many with families. (Many adorable children as a plus.) The younger/single adults are pretty chill - no one was ever too rowdy at the pool area or other common areas. 
- Access is near SO MUCH because of Hayden Tract and Downtown Culver City. The Platform (https://platformla.com/), the Metro (to SM and DTLA), Helms Bakery shopping area, Downtown Culver. Also, it is right by the 10, La Cienega, and other major streets. This is a *prime* spot to be in - I miss this area so much. 
- Other things: Amenities and services galore.The lobby smells great. Not too big (helps with that sense of community).

There is another time when the ceiling is leaking. They just sent a person to stab the dripping bubble, and that's it! They never came back to fix the hole. 3.

However, the staff said 'oh instead of ending your lease, you can do a transfer to another unit'. Then they gave us a quote on a unit that is not available for viewing. They even said we could wait for a few days for viewing. So, on that day, they knew our lease is expiring in 30 days, and they knew we intend to move out, but they gave us a suggestion that is totally & ONLY beneficial to themselves.

Jodi the owner is so sweet and helpful. Our Goldendoodle always comes back looking and smelling great. They come get her from our apartment and drop her back off. They only keep her for the time they need to groom her. All the other grooming services we have used in DC we have had to drop our pup off in the morning and they would call us when she was ready- often 10 hours later! 

They are so affordable and you can't beat the service. My dog Pita got groomed today and they called me to make sure I knew that they were concerned that she had an ear infection. We left them a dogwalker key so they could pick her up and drop her off from my apartment while I was out (again so convenient!), and they wanted to make sure I knew their concerns so they also gave me a call.

With any apartment complex, there are pros and cons, but at Innova, the pros far outweigh the cons. The building is a perfect location for Cleveland Clinic, the VA, University Hospitals, and Case Western. Even Metro Health is a short drive (10-15 minutes tops). It\u2019s always clean and never noisy (being on call overnight means sometimes I have to sleep during the day and it\u2019s incredibly quiet). My next door neighbor had a piano in her apartment for a year and I had no idea until she moved out. The staff are friendly and they\u2019ve responded to all my maintenance requests very quickly (most in the same day). After internet, parking, and rent, yes, Innova is expensive\u2026but if you shop around the area you will find that most, if not all apartments that are similar in style, amenities, and modernity, will be similarly priced. \n\nA majority of the tenants are young professionals who are here for residency/fellowship/other graduate programs. Everyone I\u2019ve run into is respectful and friendly. The Innova sky deck with fire pits and TV\u2019s is very relaxing on a nice evening. The gym is clean and very modern. I have a small dog and the concierge service is extremely helpful in walking him if I\u2019m stuck at work late one night. Location wise, you are a 12 minute walk to UH Hospital, CCF is across the street (can\u2019t beat that), and the Art Museum, Uptown area, and Little Italy are all within walking distance (less than 25 minute walk to little Italy). An Uber from the apartment to the airport is on average $20-25 and from the apartment to downtown is around $7-8. \n\nThey are completing construction on additions to Innova, Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Medical school building, and the Case Western Dental School, so the only con I can think of is construction. But if you\u2019re gone for work most of the day then it won\u2019t matter to you.

What can I do, aside from posting my name and exact address, to prove that I'm a tenant? It ought to be obvious to anybody why anyone posting would want to post anonymously to a public website, so please don't demand that I do otherwise. Did you even read my whole (long) review?  I agree with you (and others) that there *are* obvious fake ""positive"" reviews here. But they're pretty easy to spot; the language used is a big tip-off. I would love it if more FC staff posted here, as themselves, in an effort to address problems, as well as legitimately inform people about the benefits of living here. I don't condone a member of management pretending to be a tenant -- I never said there were no bad apples. I posted last year (""Now I´m kind of freaked out {previous M1 poster}""), in fact, and closed with a request that FC employees step up.  But I *am* a tenant. And my reviews are honest narratives about my experience here. I'd be happy to prove that fact if I could think of a way to do it without being an idiot (disclosing personal information).  A big part of my motivation to post the info I've posted is that if anything I say manages to attract people like me (responsible, honest, fair-minded, friendly, etc.), then I'll have neighbors I like.  I've taken a look around this site, at pages not just about apartments in SF, but in the whole state of CA, and other cities in other states, too, and I'm amazed at how many people have posted negative reviews -- not just negative, but rabid, seethingly negative. People RANT here. There are some angry---- people on this website!  And my favorite is when people have lived in a building or complex for like eight or ten years, and they're like, ""I HATE IT HERE. IT'S THE WORST PLACE EVER. IF YOU MOVE HERE YOU'RE TOTALLY TOTALLY --------!!!"" What is that about? Why did they stay, if they hate it so much?  Anyway, if you're thinking about renting an apartment here, I think you'll be ok, like I said, as long as you generally don't hate living in a major metropolis. I've never met a group of managers that were 100% perfect, and the managers here are no exception. But for me, so far, they've been ok -- really.  Also, this whole thing about security. I have to talk more about that. All you guys who are complaining that the Courtesy Patrol is a bunch of ""fake cops"" -- um, yeah. They're *not* cops. They're not even ""security."" That's why they're not called the ""Security Patrol."" They open doors and stuff. They go and get a key to let you in when you've locked yourself out. They tidy up the joint. They watch out for suspicious characters. I don't know about you, but the apartment I lived in before this one didn't even have a Courtesy Patrol, and the rent for that place was the same as it was here.  This security patrol we have here? I'll tell you what they do. I had to move most of my furniture by myself last year, when I first moved in, because I did it in the middle of the day on a weekday, and all my friends with muscles were at work. I couldn't afford to hire a moving crew, so I moved everything myself using the truck I had then. It worked out ok except for some of the larger things, which were hard to carry or drag up the long hallway to my apt. The security patrol guys who happened to be in the lobby TOTALLY HELPED ME MOVE ---- INTO MY STUDIO. I did not ask for this, they just did it.  Whatever. If you think I'm lying, then nothing I say is going to matter. But alot of you guys posting such viciously negative reviews are just as bad as the fakers.

Let me just start off by saying that we chose this building because of its great location, amenities, and being relatively new.

As we moved here a year ago, a number of things happened that really made us dislike living here.

First of all, 2 of the 4 elevators were broken for 2 months. What does that mean? It means that we had to wait for about 10 minutes for the elevator and when you combine all your walks with the dog, it was probably an hour a day. In addition, if someone was moving in, we only had 1 elevator working.

OK - I get it, things break. However, the way management was handling the issue is what really made everything worse. For example, we had 2 months left on our lease and we asked to move out early because of the elevator situation but that request was rejected. Instead, we got bagels a few times in the morning to soften the elevator issue.

Would you like to get good phone reception in your apartment? Choose another place. The cell phone booster is broken for a number of months now preventing you to work from home if you need to. When you go downstairs to the business center thinking that everything is going to work there, you get a dial-up speed Wi-Fi internet.

Lastly, what really pissed us off was the fact that we got a lease renewal that was more than what we are paying today and when we told management that we are moving out, they put our apartment on the market for $400 cheaper. Thank you.",1.0,Silver,53.0,1.0,0.0

I like email notifications about deliveries, charging stations for electric cars, great 24/7 concierges, Amazon Hub for packages, safe parking, amazing location close to 2 highways, great views, 1min walk to movies and mall, security staff, business room, recycling bins, safe elevators with a key fob access, great appliances, wooden floors, gym facilities and so much more.\n\nOf course, there are things to improve:\n1. Needs more electric vehicle charging stations for residents (and free to use).\n2. There should be no fee OR only a deposit for the housekeeping key., rather than a one time fee.\n3. Needs WiFi in a parking garage, to avoid dropped phone calls and let modern cars do their software updates.\n4. Longer parking validation. Maybe 2hrs for all, but 12hrs with a resident key.\n5. More frequent window cleaning. Maybe 4x / year rather than 2x / year.\n\nIn summary, I would move to VITA again in a heartbeat. My noted issues above are small nuances and are probably irrelevant to most people.

8/5/2009,40030,5.0,"Hands down, this apartment building is really amazing. It is run like a high-class hotel. For example, upon move-in, we were told to just leave all of our boxes against the wall in the hall and the staff would pick up everything. We were told not to worry. It was done literally minutes after we informed the front desk that the boxes were out. This is just one small example of how the building tries to make the tenants happy. The door staff also is extremely courteous and professional. The location can't be beat either. For families, there is a playground right in front of the premises. Also, in the mornings, you see many people working out in the area of the park, which is right in front as well. For lazy weekends, it's right around the corner from the Battery Park movie theater, which is rarely, if ever, crowded. Everyone in the building really seems to be happy. I've never seen anything like it. They gym is adequate as well. The deck is beautiful in the summer with amazing views. Also, after reading a prior post, I would like to dispell any myth about hearing your neighbors. We have never, ever heard any noise from an apartment next to ours, both of which are rented.

11/11/2018,43415,3.0,"We have been living at the Confluence for 4 months and it is definitely not a 5-star experience as advertised. The amenities are mostly very good (probably 4 star), but the residential services are just not there.
1) Communication of the office with the residents is subpar. When there's an important update for the residents it usually goes out after the fact or barely at the time when needed. For some reason when there's a need of re-setting ACs, we get a notification way too late after the fact. Why can't it be proactively sent, before residents are incommoded and start being cold/hot in their apartments?
2) Social events that are organized onsite are poorly held. Often timing is overlapping with other events (e.g. yoga class and residents breakfast at the same time), so you can't visit both. Random events organized without a proper informing of the residents, or with an email sent 40 mins before it happens (back to #1 problem - communication). ""Brunch"" once was coffee and donuts in a locked room. That's right, the room was locked and it wasn't exactly a brunch. ""Artistic Cocktail"" was Budweiser beer and whatever the residents brought to it. Sometimes during an event there's no Confluence representative, so the residents are left to ""hold a party"" on their own. If you really want attendance and not an impression of having an event, inform people ahead of time and stay there to supervise and bring the party together.
3) New rules appearing here and there. First they said that Valet is free and don't take tips, then over the phone told me it would be paid, then this rule seemed to go away. Now, beginning of November, signs ""No dogs allowed"" appearing next to the dog station, apparently reinforced by fines. Really? Who needs an expensive landscaping a week before the snow falls out in a building with more pets than kids? Try to ask a dog who needs to peer not to peer. Try to make dogs with disabilities walk to the nearest park. It's just not viable and is not going to happen.
4) Weirdly functioning elevators. 3 elevators seem to have a mind of their own going wherever they want and not to the appointed floor.

6/6/2004,38144,4.0,"Ok people, get ready: this is a positive review.  I've lived here for 13 months and I'm renewing my lease. I'm in a studio in M1 that's about 530 square feet. My old rent was $999 and the new rent is $1100. Considering everything, including the fact that my original deposit was less than $100, I decided not to look for another place. The truth is, I'm mostly happy here. This board is for reviews, and I'm worried about how many bad ones there still are. If I'd looked at these reviews before I moved in, I probably wouldn't have done it; fortunately I didn't see this site until after I signed the lease the first time.  Here's some info about my apartment, and in general:  Rent: Large studio $999 (they were running a special)  Deposit: $99 (again with the special)  I had a dog, and they didn't require extra rent, or an extra deposit, once they'd met my dog. I took my dog everywhere with me, including work almost every day, and I was happy to bring her along when I first came to look at the apartment. I strongly encourage anybody with a well-behaved dog to bring the dog to meet prospective landlords -- it goes a long way toward making everybody feel comfortable. Unfortunately my dog got very sick in February and had to be put down, but it makes me glad to know that I could eventually get another dog as long as I live here, and not have to worry.  Location is great -- seriously. It's not the fanciest neighborhood in SF, but it's not as sketchy as the Mission (for example). If you live in a city, you're going to have some kind of sketch element. Be smart, don't walk around drunk at 2 a.m., don't deal drugs, don't mouth off, and for the love of God if you're bothered by crazy people, or homeless people wheeling everything they own in a grocery cart, ------- volunteer your time at a shelter or a hospital, instead of bitching about how much they stink up the bus.  Oh, the bus(es): The 38 Geary is a block away; you can get downtown in about 15 minutes, if you get the Limited, which runs during rush hour in the morning and evening. Yes, it is often crowded -- put a lid on your coffee and your wallet in your front pocket, not your hip. The 22 Fillmore is across the street from me -- it runs through the Haight, down to the Mission and to Potrero Hill. Yes, this one's often filled with crazies. It's the bus -- it's not your private limo.  If you do want a private limo, though, you're in luck, since there's a free shuttle to/from the Financial District every weekday. Did I say free? Cause I meant to say FREE. That's right. It costs $0. I live in M1 and the stop is DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF MY BUILDING. It's very quiet, and never crowded. I've never had to stand. And did I mention it's free? Goddammit -- you're either saving $540/year (if you get a Fast Pass every month), or $650/year if you don't. If I were a FC employee, would I be saying you're a ------- idiot if you don't like a free shuttle? If Willie sees you running down California street downtown, because you're late and you missed him when he stopped, he'll pull over so you can jump on.  Safeway is across the street. No, it's not very fancy, but it is big. I used to live out in Excelsior, and the Safeway over there was smaller and I didn't like it. It's not as good as The Gay Safeway (Market & Church), but I'm disappointed by the Safeway situation in SF on the whole -- it's not the FC's fault.  Japan Town. It's a block away. It's neat -- there's a little Japanese grocery store over there where you can get all your Asian groceries. I am a sucker for toiletries from other lands, and my bathroom is filled with soaps and shampoos that have labels I can't read. The buildings over there are Japanese-shaped; if you sort of halfway close your eyes and blur them out of focus, it's like you're in Japan! Especially if you've never been there -- you can totally pretend. Japan Town!  Fillmore Street, toward Pacific Heights: a block away it starts getting fancy. When your parents come to visit, an overpriced dinner you can make them pay for is a five minute walk away.  Laundry in the building. It's big; it's clean; it's open 24/7. Yes, you might get your laundry stolen, if you leave it. There are signs in there saying, ""Don't leave your laundry!"" I leave my laundry all the time, because I get bored in there. But if my laundry got stolen (which it never has, in a 13 months of doing laundry), it would be my fault, for leaving it. Yes that's right.  Elevator. Yes, sometimes one of them is broken, or gets used for move-ins/outs. Yes, sometimes people spit in there, or throw trash on the floor. It's a big building, and the jackass quotient rises in direct proportion to population, wherever you are. I know I never spit in there, and if you lived here, I'd be one neighbor you'd like. And let's remember one thing: if there is a problem with the elevators, there's this whole other invention that I understand people have been using every since they could pile up rocks: it's called ""stairs."" However, I must say that, since my boyfriend's in a wheelchair, I totally dig the fact that there are elevators, so he can come and visit. And we can GET IT ON in my own apartment. Oh yeah! He can get it on! Believe it!  Enclosed back yard. I could walk my dog late at night without having to leave the property. And I always picked up her poop.  I'm on the 5th floor, in the corner, and I have four big windows that look west. Good view; sunsets every night. True.  Dishwasher. Regular-sized (as opposed to ""minis"" so many studios have) refrigerator & stove. Disposal. Microwave.  Giant bathroom. Hot water never ends (perk of living in a giant building -- giant hot water tank). People, did you hear me??? HOT WATER DOES NOT END. Once I took a 45 minute shower, just to see if I could. Stick that in your pipe.  The layout of the apartment is nice. It's still just a studio, which is one room, essentially, but the layout is good. The front door opens onto a hallway which gives the illusion of more space. While the kitchen is your typical galley-style kitchen, it's split from the living area by a breakfast bar, so it feels open. There's a nook for the bed -- the main area isn't just a big square. It's hard to describe, but the bed is about half tucked back into this nook, so you don't feel like you're in a hotel room with the bed being the main focus.  The overall storage situation is kind of crappy -- there's only one closet in the hallway but at least it's a double-wide. Not a walk-in, but I think some other units have walk-ins. For me it was more important to have living space than storage space.  Yes, there is some section 8 housing here. I don't know the details and I don't know much about section 8, but I think a company who provides a percentage of their rental units for section 8 use gets a tax right-off. How can you blame them? Let's not get into the whole debate about subsidized housing, except to point out that A. in theory, it's a great idea. B. In actual practice, it's sometimes problematic -- mostly because people who are likely to qualify have probably not had many reasons to be house-proud. Most projects are ------, and if that's what you're used to, it's hard to change your ways. Instead of bitching about welfare moms throwing trash on their doorsteps, let's try to make sure public schools get enough money, and there's lots of birth control counseling available for everybody, rich and poor. Let's try to see that everybody gets at least a chance to go to college. OK? People who are educated don't generally spray-paint elevators. That's just science.  Parking on the street is terrible, but not because of the Fillmore Center. Basically, SF shares two problems with almost every other major metropolis in which I've lived: Tickets, and break-ins. There's lots of crazy-scheduled street cleaning, and if you park on the street you have to remember to move your car all the time or you'll get an insanely high ticket. Also, some of the streets have 2 hour limits (which you can get out of by getting a neighborhood sticker from the DMV or whatever). And yes, people do bust windows. There is parking in the building, for a high monthly fee. But the thing is, everybody, why you have a car in the city? Why? I ask you: why? I had a car for 6 months when I first moved here, but I got rid of it because I didn't need it. It's easy to get around on the buses, it really is. And way cheaper overall, considering the gas and insurance. Don't get me wrong: I grew up on the East Coast and have had a car all my life until I moved here -- I'm a driving freak! Love to drive! But it's just stupid unless you're rich, or have a garage, to have one here. But that's just one girl's opinion.  As far as the management or staff goes, I haven't had to deal with them much. I met them when I moved in -- the people I saw were friendly & professional. I like that I can call somebody to let me in my apt. if I've locked myself out. I don't know why more people don't rave about this alone: locking yourself out is a pain in the ---. In the past, I've always left an extra key with a a friend, or a neighbor I knew well, but friends don't usually live next door and if you don't know your neighbors very well, you're screwed. I'm just saying. There's somebody around who will let you in at 2 in the morning. That's pretty sweet.  I have read about the graffiti and bullet holes in other buildings. I don't know about the other buildings, but M1 is ok, considering how many people live in it. No graffiti, not even in the elevator. One time somebody peeled off the ""emergency exit"" sign on my floor, but in about a week there was a new one. Thank God there was no emergency that week, is all I can say about that.  And the murders and the shootings: Yes, there are guns in SF. There are murders. I can say that the one that happened here (in front of the FootLocker in broad daylight, a couple of weeks ago) was, according to the news, a ""hit."" Meaning they shot the guy in his car because they meant to shoot that one guy in his car. I'm not saying it's ok! But I am saying that, in that one instance, it wasn't like some crazy maniac criminal (or police officer) was running around shooting off shotgun shells willy nilly in the farmer's market. I'm not squeamish myself about city living; but I'm not an idiot, and I will say I feel, overall, safer here than in the Mission. And I spend alot of time in the Mission, and would live there if I found an apartment I liked there.  What else? I know you still probably think I'm a mole, and I am signing this thing ""anonymous,"" so how do you really know? I can't sign my name or my address, because this is a public forum and I'm not --------. But would someone this funny and articulate be working for a rental company? I think not. But I've deliberately done a lot of cussing here, which I doubt my employer would condone, were my employer the Fillmore Center. Have I mentioned enough bad stuff? Probably not to make everybody happy; but as I said, this is a positive review. If I didn't like living in the city, I'd be an --- to live in the city if I had any other choice. Living in a city can be gross, crowded, uncomfortable and expensive -- I cannot argue that this isn't true. I *have* lived in both the suburbs, and the outright country, and I can say that, at least in my opionion, the sacrifices are worth the benefits, at least for me, right now. I don't have kids, or a lot of money, I'm in reasonably good health, and I do like a population that is (drum roll please) DIVERSE. It's stimulating and inspiring. I'm not in my 20s anymore, so don't go thinking I'm just talking about a wide selection of bars and restaurants. I'm talking about them, sure, but I'm also talking about the Asians in my building who I don't know very well, but who cook things in the evenings that sometimes smell weird, but mostly smell mysterious and delicious, and I wish I knew them better so I could totally eat dinner with them. Also I love the beauty-supply store across the street which sells an unbelievable variety of hairpieces, wigs, and toiletries for the African-American population. You can't find wigs in the Marina!! I don't wear a wig, but I know where to find one if I need one. I'm talking about the Brazilians who make the pizza around the corner, and it's weird how good the pizza is. Brazil. Who knew? I'm also talking about the elderly Russian couple who live on my floor: The husband can't walk very well, or speak English much, but he always holds the door for his wife, and for me; if he sees me coming, he will wait for me to get to the door even though you can tell the door is sort of heavy for him to hold. We can't talk alot because I don't speak Russian, but they smile at me like they just invented the smile, every time they see me.  Sometimes, if it's hot outside, the sidewalks in San Francisco smell like pee. But isn't it lucky that it hardly ever is hot in San Francisco? Let's count our blessings.  Oh, and last, but not least: Comcast is moving in and they're replacing the totally ------ cable. Yes, the cable is terrible. I'm looking forward to rotting my brain with way better cable than what we've got now. And I'll be happy to have a cable internet connection, so I can totally post more huge, useless reviews on this website, as necessary.  Yours,  --You Can't Have Everything, But At Least I Don't Live Under a Highway Overpass  (P.S.: All of you folks who wish the general community were of a better ""caliber,"" doesn't it make sense to recommend the FC to people you like? People you'd like to have as neighbors? I suggest that you word your reviews as objectively as possible, and make sure you assign blame for problems appropriately, so that wise viewers can reasonably judge for themselves. Most of the reviews on this site seem to be more about the neighborhood than the ""apartment community"" -- which is ok, since mentioning the neighborhood is reasonable, but it's not fair to blame the Fillmore Center for street noise, for example. If you have difficulties with management, I'd love to see specific details, instead of random name-calling. I'd like to know more about people's backgrounds: for example, if you've never lived in a city this size, say so, so people can take that into consideration.

5/25/2016,42515,5.0,"I am relocating to Seattle due to work, and was looking for apartments all over the city. I contacted JUXT and spoke to Kenny Mitchell who turned out to be amazing. 

The apartment is brand new, and everything was built with quality materials. The lounge on the roof was great, and the apartment it self was great! I am very much looking forward to moving in. 

Coming to the reason why Kenny is great; we arrived at JUXT at 4 pm on Saturday, and they normally closed at 5, by the time we could find a unit that we liked it had taken about 3.5 hours, and Kenny never once complained that he had to stay way over his shift. He was very friendly, and accommodating the entire time. He definitely made the whole leasing experience absolutely amazing! I would highly suggest contacting him if you're thinking about renting here.",1.0,Silver,53.0,5.0,1.0

First we lived in a 2 bedroom and now (before moving out) in a studio. The current maintenance team is excellent. Elliot and his team made our internal move very easy and small problems are fixed promptly.

Recently living at their sister property I was able to easily transfer to the new property with no issues or delays. The team working there are great!

You can play Pokemon GO, walk dogs, and people here are generally friendly, kindly, and really nice. 

I should still point out that this area was also the location of a major toxic chemical spill, and some of the trees actually show tumor-like structures and mutation on them STILL, even new ones, from the toxicity. 

If you are paying a hefty price for a home here, you ought to know that the building materials used to build the place were the cheapest and poorest quality construction materials, and it's very humid there and next to a marsh. I doubt that over time the structures will be able to stand up to harsh super storms.",1.0,Silver,51.0,3.0,0.0
